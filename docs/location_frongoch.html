<p>The NERC MST Radar site (52.42&deg;N, 4.01&deg;W; British National
Grid Reference SN 637 826) is situated near Capel Dewi, 6 km to the
east of Aberystwyth in West Wales, UK. Its location is indicated by
the red arrow on the map above. The radar site, at 50 m above mean sea
level (amsl), is within an approximately east-west aligned valley,
which rises up by 100 m on the north and south sides. Since this can
have a significant effect on the low-level winds, surface wind
measurements are made from Frongoch farm (52.42&deg;N, 4.05&deg;W;
British National Grid Reference SN 604 826), the location of which is
indicated by the blue arrow on the map. The base of the wind tower is
140 m amsl and 3 km to the west of the radar site.</p>
