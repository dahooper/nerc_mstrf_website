title: NERC MSTRF: Available MST Radar beam pointing directions
---

<p>In order to derive the full three-dimensional wind vector, the NERC
MST Radar uses the Doppler Beam Swinging technique. Observations must
be made in a minimum of 3 non-coplanar beam pointing directions, which
include the vertical and at 6&deg; off-vertical in two orthogonal
azimuths. There are 17 possible beam pointing directions: in the
vertical and at 4.2&deg; 6&deg;, 8.5&deg; and 12&deg; off-vertical in
a variety of azimuths. The beam directions are typically described in
terms of the nominal azimuths (shown in parentheses) which are rotated
17.5&deg; clockwise relative to the actual azinuths. Standard-mode
observations are made in the sequence NE6, SW6, Vertical, SE6, NW6,
W4.2, N4.2 which takes approximately 2.5 minutes per cycle. The use of
observations made in the vertical and a 6&deg; off-vertical in 4, as
opposed to 2, different azimuths allows for redundancy in the
determination of the wind vector; the use of observations made at
4.2&deg; off-vertical allows for the correction of beam zenith angles
for the effects of aspect sensitivity.</p>
