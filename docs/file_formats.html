title: NERC MSTRF file formats
---


The preferred file formats for datasets stored on the British
Atmospheric Data Centre are:

<UL>
  <LI>NASA-Ames (for ASCII) 
  <LI>netCDF (for binary)
</UL>

Both are self-descriptive and well-documented, ensuring that the file
contents are easy to access and easy to understand. A number of legacy
files still exist in non-standard formats, but all new datasets
created between 2001 and 2006 have used the NASA-AMES
format. Beginning in November 2006, data from the version-3 MST radar
signal processing scheme have been written straight to netCDF format
files.<BR><BR>

<B>Why netCDF has been chosen over NASA-Ames for the version-3 MST
radar data:</B>
<UL>
  <LI>netCDF is designed for the storage of array-oriented
  (e.g. time-series or time-altitude) data. It is simple to retrieve
  data for selected regions of interest without having to read in the
  contents of the whole file.
  <LI>Through use of variable "attributes", it is much simpler to store
  information about particular data products (e.g. the units used, the
  accuracy etc.) in netCDF than it is in NASA-AMES.
  <LI>Use of the Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions with
  netCDF ensures that standard names are used for standard data
  products (CF-like conventions have also been adopted in NASA-Ames
  files). 
  <LI>file reading routines are freely available for a number of
  popular programming languages: e.g. Matlab, IDL, Fortran, C, and
  Python. New datasets can be accessed in literally seconds - there is
  no need to develop a separate reading routine for each one.
