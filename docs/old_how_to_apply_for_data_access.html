<A href="how_to_apply_for_data_access.html">Click here for the most recent version</A>. 



Access to data from the NERC MST Radar Facility at Aberystwyth is provided
through the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) subject to 
<A href="conditions_of_data_access_and_use.html">conditions which can be found
  here</A>.<BR><BR>

In order to apply for access to the data, you must:
<UL>
  <LI>Register as a new user with the BADC (if you have not already done so)
  <LI>Apply for (BADC) access to "The NERC Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere
  (MST) Radar Facility at Aberystwyth" dataset
</UL>

both of which can by achieved by following the appropriate links on
the <A href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk">BADC home page</A>. You will then be
contacted by the NERC MST Radar Facility Project Scientist, who will ask you
to complete a Supporting Scientific Case (SSC) form.
<DL>
  <DD><A href="DOCS/nerc-mstrf_supporting-scientific-case-form.doc">Click here to
    download an SSC form in MS-Word format</A>
</DL>

The rest of this page contains guidance notes on how to complete the SSC
form. Please do not hesitate to <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the NERC
MST Radar Facility Project Scientist</A> if you require an SSC form in a
format other than MS-Word or if you require any additional
help with completing it. <BR><BR>

<DL>
<DT><B>GENERAL DETAILS</B>
<DD>
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Title of the project for which data access is being requested</B> -
  free text
  <DD>This should be concise and descriptive. <BR><BR>

  <A name="project_type"></A> 
  <DT><B>Project type</B> - select one option
  <DD>Most projects are expected to be of the <I>Standard</I> type. However,
  projects which are unlikely to lead to a research output, e.g. an
  undergraduate project or where access to the data is simply for teaching
  purposes, should be of the <I>Pilot</I> type. The only difference between
  the two types of application is the level of detail required in
  the <A href="#project_description">Project Description</A>.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Date of submitting this form</B> - in day/month/year format<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Expected end date of the project</B> - in month/year format
  <DD>In the case of a student, this will typically be the expected end date
  of their period of study/research. In the case of a post-doctoral researcher
  or above, this will typically be the end date of the grant which funds the
  project. This information is used by Facility staff for guidance only. Data
  access and user support will typically continue for as long as is necessary.
  </DL><BR>

<A name="applicant"></A> 
<DT><B>DETAILS OF THE PERSON REQUIRING DATA ACCESS THROUGH THE BADC</B>
<DD>If more than one person requires access for the same project, please add
  (i.e. cut and paste) a table for each additional person.
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Title and full name</B> - free text
  <DD>Where the applicant has an academic title, e.g Dr or Prof, this should
  be given. Otherwise a title such as Mr, Miss, Ms or Mrs should be given. The
  applicant's full name - including middle names or initials - should be
  given. <BR><BR> 

  <DT><B>Status</B> - free text
  <DD>In the case of a student, both the degree being studied for (e.g. BSc,
    MSc or PhD) and the subject area (e.g. atmospheric physics) should be
    given. Other examples of "status" include post-doctoral researcher,
    research fellow, lecturer, reader, and professor.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>E-mail address</B> - free text<BR><BR> 

  <DT><B>Telephone number</B> - free text
  <DD>It is not mandatory to include this information. It is unlikely to be
  relevant in the case of a BSc or MSc student. However, it is helpful if PhD
  students and above include an office telephone number. <BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Name and address of place of work</B> - free text
  <DD>In the case of an applicant based at a University, the name of the
  Department should be included in the address. In the case of a
  non-UK-based applicant, the name of the country should be included. <BR><BR> 
  </DL>

<DT><B>DETAILS OF THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE PROJECT</B>
<DD>Each project requires a Principal Investigator (PI), who must be eligible
  for a NERC grant</A>. In short, this is someone who is permanently employed
  at a UK-based research organisation (e.g. a Higher Education Institution or
  a Research Council) at lecturer level, at an equivalent level, or above
  (post-doctoral researchers on fixed-term contracts are not eligible). It
  does not have to be someone who is actually in receipt of a NERC grant. Full
  details regarding PI eligibility can be
  found <A href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/available/researchgrants/eligibility.asp">on
  the NERC website</A>. <BR><BR>

  <B>In the case of a student</B> (at any level), the PI will typically
  be their supervisor.<BR><BR> 

  <B>In the case of a non-UK-based applicant/project</B>, the PI will default to
  being the Facility's Project Scientist if no suitable UK-based collaborator
  exists - see
  <A href="conditions_of_data_access_and_use.html">Conditions of data access
  and use</A> for further details. If this is the case, details should
  additionally be given of a PI-equivalent in the applicant's own
  country. Please cut and paste an additional table for this purpose. <BR><BR>

  <B>In all cases</B>, since NERC resources are effectively being allocated to
  the PI (in the form of data), it is important that the person requiring data
  access through the BADC receives the PI's permission before an application is made
  in their name. Fill in the PI's details following the guidance given above
  for the <A href="#applicant">person requiring data access</A>.<BR><BR>
  </DL>

<DT><B>DETAILS OF FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT</B>
<DD>
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Source of funding for the project</B> - free text
  <DD>Abbreviations can be used in the case of British Research Councils -
  e.g. NERC, STFC, EPSRC. Otherwise the name of the source of funding should
  be given in full.<BR><BR>

  <DT>The following fields only need to be completed if NERC is the source of
  funding for the project. <BR><BR>
  
  <DT><B>Funding mode</B> - select one
  <DD>Options are <I>Directed</I>, <I>Blue Skies</I>, <I>Core Strategic</I>,
  <I>Commercial/Repayment</I>, and <I>Infrastructure</I>. This information is
  given on a NERC grant. If the person requiring data access is centrally
  funded, e.g. through NCAS, the <I>Core Strategic</I> option should be
  selected.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Funding type</B> - select one
  <DD>Options are <I>Studentship</I>, <I>Research Grant</I>,
  and <I>Other</I>. This information is given on a NERC grant. If the person
  requiring data access is centrally funded, e.g. through NCAS,
  the <I>Other</I> option should be selected.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Grant number</B> - free text<BR><BR>
  </DL>

<DT><B>NERC SCIENCE AREAS ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT</B> - mark each one that
  applies.<BR>

  <DD>At least one of the first four options - <I>Atmospheric</I>, <I>Earth</I>,
  <I>Marine</I>, <I>Terrestrial & Freshwater</I> - must be
  selected. Virtually all
  projects which have made use of data from the NERC MST Radar Facility have
  fallen under the <I>Atmospheric</I> area. Consequently this is the option
  which should be selected if the project does not obviously fit into any of
  the other areas. More than one of these first four areas may be selected if
  appropriate. For example, projects within NERC's Flood Risk from Extreme
  Events (FREE) programme may additionally/instead fall under
  the <I>Terrestrial & Freshwater</I> area.<BR><BR>

  If any of the final three areas - <I>Earth Observation</I>,
  <I>Science-Based Archaeology</I> and <I>Polar</I> - is appropriate, it
  should be selected in addition. More than one of these may be selected if
  appropriate. In practice, only the <I>Earth Observation</I> area is ever
  likely to be appropriate - for projects which are fundamentally associated
  with satellite observations (in addition to data from the NERC MST Radar
  Facility).<BR><BR>
  
  More details about the scope of the science areas can be found on
  the <A href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/areas/">NERC
  website</A>.<BR><BR><BR>
  </DT>
  
<DT><B>NERC SCIENCE PRIORITY AREAS ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT</B> - mark each
  one that applies.<BR>

  <DD>At least one area must be selected even if none looks immediately
 appropriate. Examples are given below of the sorts of actual research areas
 which may be fitted into some of the different science priority areas. More
 than one science priority area may be selected if appropriate.<BR><BR>

  <B>Climate System:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents or
  phenomena which can affect the climate, e.g. aerosols, clouds, water
  vapour, ozone, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, atmospheric tides,
  atmospheric (gravity) waves<BR><BR>

  <B>Biodiversity:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents or
  phenomena which affect life forms, e.g. the effects of winds on
  bird/bat/insect feeding/migration patterns<BR><BR>

  <B>Sustainable Use Of Natural Resources:</B> projects concerned
  with energy generation or energy use, e.g. wind-energy, aircraft flying
  procedures<BR><BR>

  <B>Earth System Science:</B> projects which look at the Earth system as
  a whole, e.g. the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean<BR><BR>

  <B>Natural Hazards:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents
  or phenomena which can be hazardous, e.g. volcanic dust, extreme wind
  events, rainfall, snow, flooding<BR><BR>

  <B>Environment, Pollution and Human Health:</B> projects focusing on any
  atmospheric constituents or phenomena which can affect human health,
  e.g. the dispersion of airborne pollutants by wind<BR><BR>

  <B>Technologies:</B> projects focusing on new instruments and analysis
  techniques, e.g. novel ways of processing or interpreting MST radar
  data<BR><BR><BR>

<A name="project_description"></A> 
<DT><B>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</B> - free text
  <DD>The level of detail required depends on the <A href="#project_type">
  Project Type</A>.<BR><BR>

  <B>Standard application.</B> This will be peer reviewed by members of the
  NERC Atmospheric Radar Facilities Steering Committee (NARFSC) - see
  the <A href="conditions_of_data_access_and_use.html">conditions of data use
  and access</A> for further details. Consequently the project description
  should be sufficiently detailed to allow its scientific merits to be
  evaluated. It should address the objectives of the project, its scientific
  relevance, and the proposed approach. It can be assumed that the NARFSC
  members will be familiar with common terms and concepts associated with the
  atmospheric sciences. Other specialist terms and concepts may need to be
  clarified. The project description should be approximately 1 page in
  length. If the project requires the MST radar, or any other of the
  Facility's instruments, to be operated in a special mode, details should be
  given. <BR><BR>

  <B>Pilot application.</B> This will simply be noted (rather than
  peer-reviewed) by members of the NARFSC. Consequently the project
  description does not need to be very long or very detailed. 
</DL>

The completed SSC should be mailed back to the Facility's Project
Scientist. Data access will typically be granted within 24 hours.
