title: Wind vector notation conventions
---

The horizontal wind vector, <B>v<SUB>H</SUB></B>, is represented by
the bold black line in the diagram below; <B>i</B> and <B>j</B>
represent unit vectors towards East and North, respectively. Equations
for converting horizontal wind vector information between the
different notation conventions are given <A href="#eqns">at the bottom
of this page</A>.<BR>

<P>The wind vector can be expressed either in terms of orthogonal
veocity components, where:</P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT class="red">u</FONT> is the <FONT class="red">ZONAL
      VELOCITY</FONT>, i.e. the component of the horizontal wind <FONT
      class="red">TOWARDS EAST</FONT>.
  <DD><FONT class="red">v</FONT> is the <FONT
      class="red">MERIDIONAL VELOCITY</FONT>, i.e. the component of
      the horizontal wind <FONT class="red">TOWARDS NORTH</FONT>.<BR>
  <DD>(the symbol <FONT class="red">w</FONT> is used for the <FONT
      class="red">VERTICAL VELOCITY</FONT>, which is typically +ve for
      an upward velocity).
</DL>

<P>or as a wind speed, i.e. <B>| v<SUB>H</SUB> |</B>, and
direction. Particular care should be taken when dealing with the
direction since two opposite conventions are commonly used:</P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT class="blue">&phi;<SUB>VECT</SUB></FONT> is the <FONT
      class="blue">WIND VECTOR AZIMUTH</FONT>, i.e. the <FONT
      class="blue">direction TOWARDS which the wind is
      blowing</FONT>. It increases clockwise from North when viewed
      from above. Terms such as northward, eastward etc. imply wind
      vector azimuths.<BR><BR>
  <DD><FONT class="green">&phi;<SUB>MET</SUB></FONT> is the <FONT
      class="green">METEOROLOGICAL WIND DIRECTION</FONT>, i.e. the
      <FONT class="green">direction FROM which the wind is
      blowing</FONT>. It also increases clockwise from North when
      viewed from above. Terms such as northerly, easterly etc. imply
      meteorological wind directions.
</DL>

<P>These directions are typically expressed in units of degrees,
&phi;(deg), but can either be in the interval -180&deg; to +180&deg;
or 0&deg; to 360&deg;. The wind vector azimuth and meteorological
convention direction are related by:</P>

<CENTER><IMG alt="equation" border="0" src="EQNS/eqn_phi_vect_to_met.jpg">
</CENTER>

<P>subtracting 360&deg; where appropriate in order to keep the values
within the desired range. Note that when writing a computer program to
convert between speed/direction and orthogonal component conventions,
the use of trigonometric functions assumes that angles are expressed
in units of radians, &phi;(rad), rather than degrees (pocket
calculators can typically perform trigonometric functions on angles
expressed in either units). Directions are converted from units of
degrees to radians through the relationship:</P>

<CENTER><IMG alt="equation" border="0" src="EQNS/eqn_deg_to_rad.jpg"></CENTER>

<P>Moreover, the familiar expressions relating the x component of a
vector to the cosine of its angle and the y component to its sine
imply use of:<P>

<DL>
  <DD><FONT class="red">&phi;<SUB>POLAR</SUB></FONT> which is the <FONT
      class="red">WIND VECTOR POLAR ANGLE</FONT> in two-dimensions. It
      increases ANTICLOCKWISE FROM the +ve x-axis, i.e. from EAST;
      this in the opposite sense to the wind vector azimuth and the
      meteorological wind direction, and from a different
      origin.
</DL>

<P>When converting back from orthogonal components to speed and
direction, the <B>atan2(y,x)</B> function should be used in order to
avoid ambiguity in the returned value of the wind vector polar
angle. The expressions below can be used to convert horizontal wind
vector information directly between the orthogonal component and
speed/direction conventions without the need for first converting
directions between wind the vector polar angle and the wind vector
azimuth or meteorological wind direction.</P>
