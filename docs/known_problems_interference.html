title: Known Problems: Interference
---


There are sporadic periods of what appears to be radio frequency
interference (e.g. between 1200 and 1330 UT, and at around 1700 and
1800 UT in the example above). The strength of these signals is
approximately constant as a function of altitude and typically excedes
that of the atmospheric signals at altitudes above 10 km. Since these
signals can persist for the order of a few hours, they are accepted by
the time-continuity (reliability) algorithm of version-1 signal
processing. They give rise to narrow vertical bands of clearly
anomolous wind data in the quick-look plots. The version-2 signal
processing is effective at blanking these regions, but clearly leaves
data gaps.<BR><BR>

This problem also affects version-0 products. Version-3 data products
(which are due to be made available in early 2005) are sometimes
affected, but as for the case of version-2 products, the result is
data gaps rather than contaminated data. <BR><BR>
