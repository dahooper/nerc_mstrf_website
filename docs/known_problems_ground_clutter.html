title: Known Problems: Ground Clutter
---


Under conditions of fast low-level winds, the strength of ground
clutter signals can excede that of the atmospheric returns at certain
altitudes - notably at around 2.5, 3.0 and 7.0 km. Since these ground
clutter signals tend to persist over many hours, they are accepted by
the time-continuity (reliability) algorithm used in the version-1
signal processing. The version-2 signal processing is effective at
blanking these regions, but clearly leaves data gaps.<BR><BR>  

This problem does not affect version-0 or version-3 data
products. Version-3 data products are due to be made available in
early 2005. <BR><BR>
