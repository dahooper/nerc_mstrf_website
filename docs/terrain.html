<p>The red arrows on the map above and on the picture below indicate the
location of the NERC MST Radar site (52.42&deg;N, 4.01&deg;W; British
National Grid Reference SN 637 826). The radar site is 50 m above mean
sea level (amsl). The picture was taken from approximately 80 m amsl
and 2.5 km to the west of the radar site looking along the direction
of the arrow on the map.</p>

</div>

<p>The hills to the west of the radar site generally rise to no more than
150 m amsl. Note that the contours on the 1:250,000 scale map, shown
above, represent altitude in feet rather than in metres; 1 foot is
equivalent to 0.305 m. The terrain to the east of the radar site is
much more dramatic owing to the Cambrian Mountains, which run
approximately North-South through mid-Wales. The peaks of the hills
seen in the picture immediately to the left (North) and right (South)
of the radar site (which is 50 m amsl) rise to over 140 m amsl. The
hills seen almost directly behind the radar site, at a distance of 8
km, rise to around 450 m amsl. The snow-capped peak, which is just
visible to the right of the picture, is that of Plynlimon (Pumlumon
Fawr in Welsh), which rises to 752 m amsl approximately 15 km from the
radar site.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that the radar is located within a valley, surface
wind measurements are made from Frongoch, 3 km to the west of the
site.</p>

<p>The MST radar often detects vertical velocity fluctuations of the
order of 1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, caused by mountain wave activity, when
the low-level wind direction is from between the North and South
through East, i.e. from over the mountains.</p>
