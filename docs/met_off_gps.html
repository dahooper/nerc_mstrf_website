The Met Office is involved in a number of collaborative projects to
assess the potential of new observational networks under the
<B>COST</B> framework (European <B>Co</B>-operation in the Field of
<B>S</B>cientific and <B>T</B>echnical Research). Since the movement
of water vapour can transport latent heat and moisture considerable
distances, and since water vapour is an important greenhouse gas,
knowledge of its distribution throughout the atmosphere is of
considerable interest for both numerical weather prediction and
climate applications. A new technique to measure the integrated water
vapour (IWV) relies on the delay of radio signals received from Global
Positioning System (GPS) satellites. The IWV represents the total water
vapour content of atmosphere along the path between the GPS satellite
and the receiver; most of this is contained within the lowest few
kilometres of the atmosphere. The primary objective of COST-716 is to
assess the operational potential for a ground-based GPS system to
provide near-real-time observations of IWV. The Aberystwyth instrument
is one of several owned by the Met Office within the UK.<BR><BR>

The data from this instrument are now available through the NERC MST
Radar Facility dataset on the British Atmospheric Data Centre. The
data represent 1 hour averages.<BR><BR>
