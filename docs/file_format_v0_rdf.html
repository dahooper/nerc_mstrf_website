These files contain 12 minute averaged radial (i.e. along-beam)
profiles of the radar return parameters (signal-to-noise ratio, signal
power, Doppler shift and signal width) for different beam pointing
directions. The same data are stored in ASCII format files - please <A

                        RADIAL WIND FILES
                        -----------------

        File name :- RDFyyMMdd.DAT   where yyMMdd is the date.

        RANDOM ACCESS FILE  -  FORMATTED
        RECORD   -  36 BYTES

        Data is FORMATTED unless stated otherwise.
        For UNFORMATTED data:
        B  = BYTE
        I2 = INTEGER*2 (2 byte integer)
        I4 = INTEGER*4 (4 byte integer)

        DATA IN RADIAL WIND (RDF) FILE
        ------------------------------

        Each RDF file contains the results of processing the Doppler 
        spectra from the MST Radar for one day.

        The results for each Doppler spectrum include:
          the centre frequency of the peak,
          the signal level,
          the signal to noise ratio and
          the estimated peak width.

        The RDF file is formed by concatenating all Radial wind (RW) files 
        obtained on one day. These RW files have filenames RWyyMMdd_hhmm.nn 
        where hhmm is the time (UT) of the start of that data subset 
        and nn is the duration in minutes.

        Each set of radial winds is calculated from the doppler spectra
        from one beam direction (dwell) averaged over 12 minutes of
        viewing in that direction.

        The RDF file contains one header of peak extraction parameters
        then alternating dwell header records and data records.

        Peak Extraction Parameter records provide information about
        the operating and processing parameters that were used.

        Some records have an I1 identification field at the start to show 
        the type of information they contain.

        The timing of the data can be read from the dwell header. 


        RECORD ORDERING.
        ----------------
        The Peak Extraction Parameter Records only occur once per day,
        at the start of the RDF file after the first RW file name.
        The Dwell Header Records precede the Data Records to which
        they apply. 
        
        Ident   Record                          Comment

          ONLY WRITTEN ONCE AFTER FIRST RW FILE NAME.

          Contains parameters relating to the methods used to find the
          spectral peak and estimate the doppler shift.

        Dwell header
        ------------
          Information relating to a dwell.

          The following data is UNFORMATTED.

        Dwell number in cycle.                          I2
        Antenna beam number.                            I2

        Total integration count ( NPP ).                I2
        Length of FFT ( LFT ).                          I2

        Mean time, yy MM dd  hh mm ss .               6*B
        First height bin range (NH1,NH2).             2*I2
        Second height bin range (NH3,NH4).            2*I2
        Height bin increment.                           I2
 


        Data record.
        ------------
          Information derived from Doppler spectra.

          Get heights from the bin parameters in the dwell header:
          Data bins are NH1 to NH2 followed by
          NH3 to NH4 if upper height data was collected.

          The following data is UNFORMATTED.

        Doppler frequency of peak ( milli Hertz )       I2

        The 3 values below given as a 4 byte integer    I4

        Signal to noise, ( 0.1 dBs ) + 1024           11 Least Significant Bits
        Signal strength, ( 0.1 dBs ) + 1024      Next 11 bits
        Width of peak ( FFT points )                  10 Most Significant Bits

          Width of peak can be expressed in Hz 
          by multiplying the value in FFT points by 
          1.0 / ( 1E-6 * IPI * NPP * LFT )
 
          Thus data for one height bin uses I2+I4=6 bytes

        Each data record includes data for 6 bins   ( 36 bytes )
          The last record of a dwell usually has less.

        Trailer record.
        ---------------
          Indicates end of data in the file.

        Identifier for Trailer record ( 0 ).            I1


        HEIGHT DERIVATION
        -----------------

	Height at range bin n is given by :-  Ht = (n - Bz) * HI

	Bz is the sea level range bin,
          derived as follows from dwell header parameters:
	NRX = Receiver filter (microsecs).
	LTX = Transmitter pulse width (microsecs).
	If NRX = 1  Bz = 5.7 ( unless LTX = 1 when Bz = 5.2 )
	If NRX = 2  Bz = 6.7
	If NRX = 4  Bz = 8.7
	If NRX = 8  Bz = 12.7

	HI is the height increment per bin.
          derived as follows from dwell header parameter:
	NBM = Antenna beam number.
	If NBM = 0               HI = 0.15 Km.    ( Vertical )
	If NBM = 1,3,5 or 7      HI = 0.1496 Km.  ( 4.2 Deg. )
	If NBM = 2,4,6 or 8      HI = 0.1484 Km.  ( 8.5 Deg. )
	If NBM = 9,11,13 or 15   HI = 0.1492 Km.  ( 6.0 Deg. )
	If NBM = 10,12,14 or 16  HI = 0.1467 Km.  ( 12.0 Deg.)
