The figure below shows a typical Doppler spectrum observed by the NERC
MST Radar. Power Spectral Densities (PSDs) are shown in both log
(i.e. dB) and self-normalised linear units as each panel emphasises
slightly different features. They are stored in dB units in the
spectral files (<FONT class="code_red">PSD_dB</FONT>) but must be
converted into linear units (<FONT
class="code_red">PSD_linear_units</FONT>) before processing is carried
out:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT class="code_red">
PSD_dB = 10.0 * log10(PSD_linear_units)<BR><BR>
PSD_linear_units = 10.0^(PSD_dB/10.0)</FONT></CENTER><BR>

Positive values of Doppler velocity imply motion away from the
radar. The number of velocity bins within a spectrum is given in the
spectral and radial data files by by the variable <FONT
class="code_blue">number_of_complex_samples_in_discrete_fourier_transform</FONT>,
abbreviated here as <FONT class="code_red">N_DFT</FONT>. Velocity bin
numbers (<FONT class="code_red">b</FONT>) run from <FONT
class="code_red">(-N_DFT/2)</FONT> to <FONT class="code_red">(N_DFT/2
- 1)</FONT>. The corresponding Doppler velocity values (<FONT
class="code_red">v_Doppler</FONT>), which are stored by the spectral
file variable <FONT class="code_blue">doppler_velocity</FONT>, are
given by:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT class="code_red">v_Doppler(b) = b * delta_v_Doppler
</FONT></CENTER><BR>

where the spacing between velocity bins (<FONT
class="code_red">delta_v_Doppler</FONT>) is stored by the radial file
variable <FONT class="code_blue">spectral_velocity_bin_spacing</FONT>.
Note that spectra are cyclic about the Nyquist velocity, i.e. about
velocity bin <FONT class="code_red">(-N_DFT/2)</FONT>. <BR><BR>

Observed spectra typically consist of a single (quasi-Gaussian) radar
return signal component (although there are sometimes additional
signal components) superimposed on a background of white
noise. The latter implies quasi-constant PSD values at all velocity
bins.

<B>Removal of dc contamination</B><BR>

DC biases in the raw radar samples lead to contamination of the PSD
for the zero-Doppler-velocity velocity bin, i.e. at <FONT
class="code_red">b = 0</FONT>. This must be removed from the recorded
spectra before processing can begin. If a Hanning rather than a
Rectangular window is used in deriving the spectra (this choice is
recorded by the spectral and radial file variable <FONT
class="code_blue">data_weighting_window_index</FONT>), the
contamination is additionally spread to the velocity bins to either
side, i.e. it affects velocity bins from <FONT class="code_red">(b =
-1)</FONT> to <FONT class="code_red">(b = +1)</FONT>. The
contamination is typically removed by replacing the PSDs with values
linearly interpolated between those at the velocity bins to either
side of affected region. The dc contamination has been removed from
the spectrum shown above.


<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Determination of (mean) noise PSD</B><BR>

The (mean) noise PSD (<FONT class="code_red">PSD_noise</FONT>) is
determined by the method of <A href="#hildebrand74">Hildebrand and
Sekhon (1974)</A>. It is shown by the magenta line in the figure
above. It can typically only be seen in the log plots as it tends to
be very small compared to the peak signal PSD. The noise power in
linear units (<FONT class="code_red">P_noise_linear_units</FONT>) is
simply the noise PSD integrated across the width of the
spectrum:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT class="code_red">
P_noise_linear_units = PSD_noise_linear_units * N_DFT</FONT></CENTER><BR>

This is stored in dB units by the radial file variable <FONT
class="code_blue">noise_power</FONT> (abbreviated here as <FONT
class="code_red">P_noise_dB</FONT>). The noise PSD in dB units can
therefore be derived from the recorded noise power as:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT class="code_red">
PSD_noise_dB = P_noise_dB - 10.0*log10(N_DFT)</FONT></CENTER><BR>

For spectra derived using a Rectangular window, leakage from strong
signal components can affect all velocity bins - see e.g. <A
  href="#hooper99">Hooper (1999)</A>. This leads to an
overestimate of the noise level, which is otherwise expected to be
constant at all range gates. A better estimate of noise level can
therefore be obtained by taking the median value over all range
gates. The noise power is dominated by broad-band lower-VHF
galactic radiation, which undergoes a distinct quasi-diurnal variation
of almost 4 dB amplitude. 

<BR><BR><BR>
<B>Determination of signal component velocity bin limits</B><BR> 

A smoothed (linear) spectrum is derived by applying a 5-velocity-bin
running-mean (cyclically) to the observed PSDs. The velocity bin
limits of the signal component are determined by first locating the
peak value of the smoothed PSD. The ratio of this value to the mean
noise PSD, in dB units, is recorded by the radial file variable <FONT
class="code_blue">peak_smooth_psd_to_noise</FONT>. Note that this is a
measure of detectability and is not the same as the signal-to-noise
ratio, which is typically defined as the ratio of the signal power to
the noise power. The smoothed PSD envelope is followed out to either
side of this peak location until:

<UL> 
  <LI>the value drops below the noise PSD<BR><BR>

  <LI>the value drops below 0.01 of the peak smoothed PSD value, if
  this is reached before dropping below the noise PSD. This condition
  is particularly important where use of a Rectangular window has led
  to spectral leakage. It prevents low PSD values at the edges of signal
  components from having a disproportionately large effect on the
  spectral width values. Such low values would have a negligible
  contribution to the total signal power power - see e.g. <A
  href="#hooper99">Hooper (1999)</A>.<BR><BR>

  <LI>it encounters a local minimum for which the smoothed PSD value
  is less than 0.1 of the peak smoothed PSD value. This condition is
  important for resolving partially-overlapping clear-air
  (i.e. desirable) and unwanted signal components.  
</UL><BR>

These (inclusive) limits - recorded by the radial file variables <FONT
class="code_blue">first_velocity_bin_number</FONT> and <FONT
class="code_blue">final_velocity_bin_number</FONT>, but abbreviated
here as <FONT class="code_red">b1</FONT> and <FONT
class="code_red">b2</FONT> - are shown by the blue lines in the figure
above. 

During the process of signal identification, the observed spectrum is
first extended with a copy of itself being wrapped around the Nyquist
velocity bin to either side, i.e. <FONT class="code_red">(b =
-N_DFT/2)</FONT> and <FONT class="code_red">(b =
+N_DFT/2)</FONT>. A partially velocity-aliased signal component,
i.e. one which is apparent at both Doppler velocity bin extremes of
the original spectrum, is indicated in the radial files by having
ones of its velocity bin limits being extended beyond the expected
range of <FONT
class="code_red">(-N_DFT/2)</FONT> to <FONT class="code_red">(N_DFT/2 -
1)</FONT>.<BR><BR><BR>


<B>Calculation of the principal parameters for the signal component</B><BR>

The three lowest-order moments (<FONT class="code_red">m_0</FONT>,
<FONT class="code_red">m_1</FONT>, and <FONT
class="code_red">m_2</FONT>) of the signal component are calculated
from the the PSDs (in linear units) within the velocity bin limits
which have been:

<UL> 
  <LI>Corrected for noise, i.e. by subtracting the mean noise PSD
  <LI>Compensated for the low-pass filtering effect of coherent
  integration by multiplying them by a factor <FONT
  class="code_red">CIC</FONT> - see. e.g. <A href="#rastogi83">Rastogi
  (1983)</A>. This has a value of 1.0 at <FONT class="code_red">(b =
  0)</FONT> and of up to a few dB at the edges of the spectrum.:

The signal component power (<FONT class="code_red">P_signal</FONT>),
radial velocity (<FONT class="code_red">v_R</FONT>) and spectral width
(<FONT class="code_red">&sigma;_w</FONT>) are given by:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><IMG src="EQNS/eqn_signal-component-parameters.png"></CENTER>
<BR>

They are stored by the radial file variables <FONT
class="code_blue">signal_power</FONT>, <FONT
class="code_blue">radial_velocity</FONT>, and <FONT
class="code_blue">spectral_width</FONT>, respectively. These can be
used to define the magnitude, the central location and the standard
deviation, respectively, of an equivalent Gaussian signal component -
shown by the orange feature in the figure below - which give rise to
the same values of the three lowest-order moments.
