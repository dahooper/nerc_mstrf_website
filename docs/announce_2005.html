<B>2005-03-21: Unaveraged version-0 and version-2 data products
  now available for all MST radar observations.</B><BR>

The entire MST radar observation archive has now been reprocessed
using both version-0 (without time averaging) and version-2 signal
processing software. <A href="sig_proc_version_nrs.html">Click
here</A> to find out more about the different version numbers.<BR><BR>

The
unaveraged version-0 data products were previously only stored as far
back as 2001. Since, in any case, the signal processing scheme had
changed gradually over the years (but not since 2001), this exercise
has ensured that all unaveraged version-0 files (available through the
BADC) relate to the same version of the software. The archive of 12
minute averaged version-0 data products was already more complete and
so has been left untouched. Since unaveraged data products are
typically much more useful than averaged data products, there are no
plans to recreate the archive of the latter using the last available
version of the software. However, please <A

NERC MST Radar Facility Project Scientist</A> if you have a
requirement for these files. <BR><BR>

Version-2 processing, which was introduced in late 2004, is basically
identical to version-1 processing, but the files contain more
comprehensive reliability flagging. For this reason, there are no
plans to extend the archive of version-1 products, which is primarily
limited to the period June 2003 - December 2004. <BR><BR>

<A href="file:/home/dahooper/WEB/NERCmst/plots_access.html">Quick-look
MST radar plots</A>, based on the version-2 data products, are also
now available for the entire observation archive. Since useful radar
returns from mesospheric altitudes occur only sporadically, and are of
limited vertical extent, the quick-look plots of M-mode data simply
show signal power. They are consequently only useful for identifying
days on which useful radar returns were observed. The ST-mode
quick-look plots should also only be used as a way of identifying days
which are worthy of further investigation. This is particularly true
of observations made between 1989 and 1996, when observations were
often only made for 12 minutes at 3-hourly intervals.
