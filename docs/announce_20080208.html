<B>Error in MST Radar altitudes (and ranges) for the period 2007-02-06
- 2008-02-07</B><BR><BR>

<B>NOTE: the contents of this page have now be superseded by those of
<A href="announce_20080416.html">announcement for
2008-04-16</A>.</B><BR><BR>

Owing to a bug in the <A href="mstr_new_acquisition_system.html">new
MST radar control and data acquisition system</A>, which began
operations at 13:44 UT on 6th February 2007, there has been an error
of approximately 1 km in the reported ranges and altitudes of data
products. The quality of the data appears to be otherwise
unaffected. A compensation for this error was introduced to the signal
processing software, starting at 12:48 UT on 7th February 2008. A fix
for the radar control and data acquisition software will need to be
applied in the near future.

<BR><BR>
<B>Which files are affected?</B>
<UL>
  <LI><B>spectral</B> data from 2007-02-06 13:44 UT onwards
  <LI><B>radial</B> data from 2007-02-06 13:44 UT until 2008-02-07 12:48 UT
  <LI><B>Cartesian</B> data from 2007-02-06 13:44 UT until 2008-02-07 12:48 UT
  <LI><B>Met Office</B> data from 2007-02-06 13:30 UT until 2008-02-07 11:00 UT
</UL>

<BR>
<B>How to compensate for this error in affected data</B>
<UL>
  <LI>For <B>spectral</B> and <B>radial</B> data:<BR>
  actual range gate number = recorded range gate number + 7<BR>
  actual range (of range gates from radar) = recorded range + 1050.0 m
  <LI>for <B>Cartesian</B> data: <BR>
  actual range gate number = recorded range gate number + 7<BR>
  actual altitude (of range gates above mean sea level) = recorded altitude + 1044.2 m
</UL>

<B>Evidence for the problem</B><BR> 

As can be seen from the <A href="#first">first of the two plots
below</A>, the problem is not necessarily immediately obvious in
comparisons with wind-profile data from radiosondes (black lines)
launched at Aberport, which is located 45 km to the SW of the radar
site. This is why it took so long to identify the problem. It is
typically only when there are sharp changes in wind vector with
altitude, e.g. around the jet in the <A href="#second">second plot
below</A>, that the altitude mismatch is clear. <BR><BR>

The radar data correspond to 1 hour averages, starting at the time of
the radiosonde launch. Wind directions are according to the
meteorological convention, i.e. from which the wind is blowing. The red
and yellow crosses show, respectively, the radar data without and with
altitude compensation.  <BR><BR>

It was known, from monthly comparison statistics against the Met
Office model, that the switch to the new radar control and data
acquisition system had lead to the following changes: 

<UL>
  <LI>there was an increased bias in the differences between radar and
  model wind (northward and eastward) components
  <LI>the magnitude of this bias was a maximum around the tropopause
  level, i.e. where there is typically a sharp reduction in wind speed
  with increasing altitude
  <LI>the wind direction was largely unaffected
  <LI>there was a decrease in radar altitude coverage
</UL>

this problem.<BR><BR>
