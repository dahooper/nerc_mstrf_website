title: Climate data logger

Surface meteorological parameters (i.e. air temperature, pressure and
relative humidity, and rainfall and downwelling shortwave radiation)
are recorded at 10 minute intervals at the NERC MST radar site
(52.42&deg;N, -4.01&deg;E, 50 m above mean sea level; British National
Grid Reference: SN637826). Data are available from 25th July 2000 to
the present. There are a number of gaps in the dataset owing to
instrument problems and down-time for maintenance.  <BR><BR>

Data are recorded with a (Met Office approved) CR10 "Climate Data
Logger" from Campbell Scientific using the following sensors:

<DL>
  <DT><B>Temperature</B> 
  <DD>Campbell Scientific 107 thermistor temperature probe mounted
  inside a URS1 unaspirated radiation shield. Accuracy: +/- 0.4
  &deg;C.

  <DT><B>Pressure</B> 
  <DD>Vaisala PTB101B barometric pressure sensor. Accuracy: +/- 2.0
  hPa.
  
  <DT><B>Relative humidity</B> 
  <DD>(Vaisala) HMP45C temperature and relative humidity probe (from
  which only the humidity measurements are used) mounted inside a URS1
  unaspirated radiation shield. Accuracy: +/- 0.3%.

  <DT><B>Rainfall</B> 
  <DD>(Environmental Measurements) ARG100 tipping bucket
  raingauge. Note that occasional build-up of fungus within the inlet
  tube can impede or even completely inhibit the flow of rain into the
  instrument. This makes the rain data the least reliable of the
  surface meteorological measurements.

  <DT><B>Downwelling shortwave radiation</B>
  <DD>(Kipp and Zonen) CM3 thermopile pyranometer (WMO second
  class). Accuracy: +/- 0.5%.

</DL>

The raingauge is located on the ground. All other sensors are mounted
on a post approximately 1 m above the ground.<BR><BR>

The data logger initially samples the atmospheric temperature,
pressure and humidity sensors at 5 s intervals. Mean values are
calculated over each 60 s and the outputs from the logger represent
minima, means and maxima of these 60 s means over each 10 minute
sample period.<BR><BR>

The data logger initially samples the tipping bucket raingauge every 1
s and records a tip for each 0.20 mm accumulation of rain. The output
from the logger represents the total accumulation of rain over the
each 10 minute sample period.<BR><BR>

The data logger initially samples the pyranometer every 5 s and
records the downwelling radiation (within a hemispheric field of view)
with a flat response in the spectral range 305 - 2800 nm. The output
from the logger represents the accumulation of energy per unit area
within each 10 minute sample period. The measured radiation is
compared with that predicted for the logger's latitude and longitude,
and for the time of year and the time of day (assuming clear sky
conditions). A sunshine priod is defined as one in which the ratio
excedes 0.4 and the output from the logger represents the accumulated
sunshine duration within each 10 minute sample period.  Note that this
is an estimated product, which is not derived according to the WMO
definition of sunshine duration.<BR><BR>

The data logger records the instantaneous battery voltage and internal
temperature at the end of each 10 minute sample period for performance
checking purposes.<BR><BR>
