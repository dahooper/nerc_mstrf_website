<B>ELIGIBILITY</B><BR> 

In general, data from the NERC MST Radar Facility at Aberystwyth will be made
freely available to anyone requiring them for academic research, or
educational projects, subject to the following conditions.<BR><BR>

Anyone requiring the data for commercial purposes
should <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the NERC MST Radar Facility
Project Scientist</A> for further details. Charges will apply.
<BR><BR>

The remit of the <A href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk">Natural Environment Research
Council (NERC)</A> is to fund world-class science which increases knowledge
and understanding of the natural world. This includes funding facilities such
as the MST Radar Facility at Aberystwyth. The provision of data from such
facilities is therefore equivalent to the allocation of NERC
resources. Consequently each application for access to the data - which is
referred to as a <A href="how_to_apply_for_data_access.html">Supporting
Scientific Case (SSC)</A> - will be peer-reviewed by members of the NERC
Atmospheric Radar Facilities Steering Committee (NARFSC). This process ensures
that NERC resources - including the time of Facility staff - are being
allocated in the best possible way. It does not affect the timing of data
access being granted, which will typically occur within a day of an SSC being
submitted. <BR>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Non-NERC-funded projects/data-users.</B> NERC does not restrict data
    access to members of its designated community, i.e. to researchers and PhD
    students who are funded by its grants. However, in general, it expects
    only limited Facility staff time to be dedicated to supporting non-NERC
    projects. Higher levels of support may be deemed to be appropriate for
    projects whose scope clearly falls within NERC's science
    remit</A>. <BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Non-UK-based projects/data-users.</B> In order for NERC to gain the
    appropriate credit for supporting non-UK-based science, it is necessary
    for publications making use of data from the Facility to include a
    UK-based co-author. If the project does not have a UK-based collaborator
    who can fulfil this role, the Facility's Project Scientist must be
    included as a co-author (and also as the Principal Investigator - see
    next point). <BR><BR>

  <DD><B>All projects</B> must have a Principal Investigator (PI) who is
  eligible for a NERC grant</A>. In summary, this is someone who is
  permanently employed by a UK-based research organisation (e.g. a Higher
  Education Institution or a Research Council) at lecturer level, at an
  equivalent level, or above. It does not have to be someone who is actually
  in receipt of a NERC grant. Since the PI is the person to whom NERC
  resources are effectively being allocated, it is important that they give
  their consent for an application to be made in their name.
</DL><BR>

<A name="purpose"></A>
<B>PURPOSE OF USE</B><BR> Access to data from the Facility, through the
British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC), will be granted in connection with a
specific, non-commercial project. The data may only be used for the purposes
of this project. A separate SSC should be submitted for each additional
project which requires access to the data. <BR><BR><BR>


<A name="ownership"></A>
<B>OWNERSHIP</B><BR> The data remain the property of the appropriate funding
body, i.e. NERC except in the case of the GPS Integrated water vapour data and
boundary-layer wind-profiler data (Met Office), and the cloud radar data
(Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Millimetre-Wave Technology Group). The data
may not be passed on to any third party.<BR><BR><BR>


<A name="acknowledgements"></A>
<B>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS AND DATASET CITATION</B><BR>
Where the data are used in a presentation or publication, an appropriate
acknowledgement must be given:<BR>

<DL>
  <DD><B>In the case of data from NERC instruments</B> - i.e. the MST Radar,
the surface meteorological sensors, the surface wind sensors, the laser
ceilometer, and the sky camera - a sentence should be included along the lines
of, <I>"The MST Radar Facility at Aberystwyth is funded by the UK Natural
Environment Research Council and the data are provided through the British
Atmospheric Data Centre"</I><BR><BR>

  <DD><B>In the case of data from Met Office instruments</B> - i.e. the
boundary-layer wind-profiler or GPS water-vapour receiver - a sentence should
be given along the lines of, <I>"Data from the boundary-layer
wind-profiler/GPS water-vapour receiver are provided courtesy of the Met
Office through the British Atmospheric Data Centre."</I><BR><BR>

<DD><B>In the case of data from the RAL cloud radar</B>, a sentence should be
given along the lines of -
<I>"Data from the cloud radar are provided courtesy of the Rutherford
Appleton Laboratory Millimetre-Wave Technology Group through the
British Atmospheric Data Centre."</I><BR>
</DL>

Moreover, the dataset (which covers all instruments) should be cited in
publications in the same way as an academic article, i.e. by including a
reference in the main body of the text (this could be in the Acknowledgements
section) in one of the following two forms:

<DL>
  <DD>Natural Environment Research Council (<I>Year-of-citation</I>)<BR><BR>
      NERC (<I>Year-of-citation</I>)<BR>
</DL>

and with a corresponding entry in the bibliography/references section of the
form:<BR>

<DL>
  <DD>Natural Environment Research Council, Aberystwyth Radar Facility,
[Hooper, D.]. The NERC Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) Radar
Facility at Aberystwyth, [Internet]. British Atmospheric Data Centre, 2006-,
<I>Date-of-citation</I>. Available from
http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/mst.<BR>
</DL>

where (<I>Date-of-citation</I>) is the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format) on which the
files were downloaded (if files were downloaded at different times, the date of
the last download can be used) and (<I>Year-of-citation</I>) is just the year
part of that.<BR><BR><BR>

<A name="protection"></A>
<B>DATA PROTECTION ACT</B><BR> 

The Facility will make details of its registered data users, and of their
projects, available to NERC and its delegated authorities. The latter include
staff of the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and members of the
NERC Atmospheric Radar Facilities Steering Committee (NARFSC). This 
allows NERC to establish whether or not the Facility continues to be
a necessary and effective component for supporting research within its science
remit. <BR><BR>

The details of publications making use of data from the Facility will be made
publicly available, e.g. on the <A href="publications_by_year.html">Facility's
website</A>.<BR><BR>

Limited details of current and recently-completed projects may be given in
the <A href="annual_reports_to_nerc.html">Facility's annual reports to
NERC</A>, which are publicly available.<BR><BR><BR>


<A name="updates"></A>
<P><B>PROJECT UPDATES</B><BR> 
Registered data users are obliged to provide the Facility with the following
updates whenever they are requested to do so (typically once a year)

<DL>
  <DD><B>Details of publications</B> which make use of data from the Facility,
    including data from guest instruments which have been operated at the
    radar site. This information will typically be requested at the beginning
    of a calendar year, so that all publications from the previous
    calendar year are captured. <BR><BR>

  <B>Details of data use</B>. This information will typically be requested
  towards the end of each financial year and should cover
  the whole of that financial year, i.e. the period between April and the
  following March. It does not need to be very long or very detailed - a
  single paragraph should suffice. It just needs to give an indication of
  progress with the project. 
</DL>
