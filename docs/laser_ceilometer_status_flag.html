title: The LD40 Laser Ceilometer Satus Flag
---

The LD40 laser ceilometer performs a number of self-check and
self-adjustment routines for each 15 s measurement cycle. Error and
warning messages are coded within an 8 digit instrument status
integer. A value of 99999999 implies that no observations were
made. Zeros in the first seven digits imply that the instrument was
functioning correctly. The interpretation of individual digits is as
follows:

<DL><B>Status Digit 1 (most significant digit): Power supply</B>
  <DD>0: Power supply OK.
  <DD>1: +/-5 V or +/- 12 V supply failure.
  <DD>2: Not used.
  <DD>3: Avalanche photodiode voltage regulator failure.
  <DD>4: Test laser voltage regulator failure.
  <DD>5: Original laser voltage regulator failure.
  <DD>6: No response from AD/DA converter.
</DL>
     
<DL><B>Status Digit 2: Window backscatter and solar shutter</B>
  <DD>0: Window backscatter and solar radiation measurements within allowed range.
  <DD>1: Window scatter > 50%. Window requires cleaning.
  <DD>2: Solar radiation too strong. Shutter is closed.
</DL>
    
<DL><B>Status Digit 3: Receiver</B>  
  <DD>0: Receiver OK.
  <DD>1: Offset too low.
  <DD>2: Offset too high.
  <DD>3: Not used.
  <DD>4: Receiver sensitivity too low. Error. No more measurements possible.
  <DD>5: Receiver sensitivity too low and offset too low.
  <DD>6: Receiver sensitivity too low and offset too high.
</DL>
      
<DL><B>Status Digit 4: Original laser and test laser</B>
  <DD>0: Transmitter module OK.
  <DD>1: Laser power low. Warning only. Measurements continue.
  <DD>2: Laser power too low. Error. No more measurements possible.
  <DD>3: Not used.
  <DD>4: Not used.
  <DD>5: Test laser failure. Error. No more measurements possible.
  <DD>6: Original laser switched off.
</DL>
      
<DL><B>Status Digit 5: Flash-ADC</B>
  <DD>0: Flash-ADC OK.
  <DD>1: One flash-ADC error during regulation of the bias voltage of the avalanche photodiode.
  <DD>2: Several flash-ADC errors during regulation of the bias
  voltage of the avalanche photodiode.
  <DD>3: Flash-ADC failure.
  <DD>4: Flash-ADC too slow during normal measurements. No reply.
</DL>
     
<DL><B>Status Digit 6: Temperature regulation</B>
  <DD>0: Temperature regulation OK.
  <DD>1: Temperature controller defect.
</DL>  
    
<DL><B>Status Digit 7: Reset and data reception</B>   
  <DD>0: Data transmission OK.
  <DD>1: Sensor will perform a reset.
  <DD>2: Not used.
  <DD>3: Not used.
  <DD>4: Not used.
  <DD>5: Not used.
  <DD>6: Not used.
  <DD>7: Received and calculated checksum differ.
  <DD>8: Received command message is too long.
</DL>

<DL><B>Status Digit 8 (least significant digit): Setup information</B>
        
  <DD>0: Current setup is the setup stored in the EEPROM.
  <DD>1: EEPROM failure. Current setup if the default setup.
  <DD>2: Setup has been changed by the user and is different from
	   the EEPROM and default setups.
  <DD>3: Not used.
  <DD>4: In case of failures, the message contains dashes instead of
	   data.
  <DD>5: EEPROM is defective. Current setup is the default setup and
           the message contains dashes instead of data.
  <DD>6: Setup has been changed by the user and is different to the
           EEPROM and default setups. The message contains dashes
           instead of data.
