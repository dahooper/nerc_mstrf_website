<B>The 10th International Workshop on Technical and Scientific Aspects of
   MST Radar<BR>
   Piura, Peru<BR>
   13 - 20 May 2003
</B><BR>
 <P><A href="http://jro.igp.gob.pe/mst10/">This workshop now has its own
home-page</A></P>

<P>The international workshop on MST radar, held about every 2-3 years,
is a major event gathering together experts from all over the world,
engaged in research and development of radar techniques to study the
mesosphere, stratosphere, troposphere (MST). It offers also excellent
opportunities to young scientists, research students and also new
entrants to the field for close interactions with the experts on all
technical and scientific aspects of MST radar techniques.</P>

<P>The tenth MST radar workshop, MST10, as the previous MST workshops,
will focus on the following topics:</P>

<UL>
  <LI>Radar scattering processes in the neutral atmosphere
  <LI>D, E, and F region coherent scattering (PMSE, Es, EEJ, ESF)
  <LI>Winds, waves and turbulence in the lower and middle atmosphere
  <LI>Meteorological phenomena and applications.
  <LI>Operational aspects and recent system developments
</UL>
 
<P>As a new approach, the workshop MST10 will consist of two major
parts
<UL>
  <LI>Standard workshop papers presented orally or as posters (4days)
  <LI>A brain-storming meeting (1.5 days) with the aim to
      highlight open questions and potential solutions, to produce proposals
      for innovative approaches, define new programs and prepare
      recommendations.
</UL>
 
<P>The latter bases on the Permanent Working Groups of the MST radar
community on:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>System Calibrations and Definitions
  <LI>Data Analysis, Validation and Parameter Deduction Methods
  <LI>Accuracies and Requirements for Meteorological Applications
  <LI>International Collaborations
</OL>
 
<P>The workshop MST10 will be held at the wonderful campus of the <A
href="http://www.udep.edu.pe">Universidad de Piura (UDEP)</A> in
northern Peru. This site is known due to its operation of ST and
boundary layer radars, which are part of the activities of the
Instituto Geofsico del Peru, operating the <A
href="http://jro.igp.gob.pe">Jicamarca Radio Observatory (JRO)</A>, in
collaboration with international institutions like the University of
Colorado (via CIRES) and NOAA (via the Aeronomy Lab).  Included in the
workshop activities are site-seeing tours and a visit of the Jicamarca
Radio Observatory in Lima.</P
 
<P>The International Steering Group of MST10 consists of: J. Roettger
(Chair, Germany), J. Chau (Peru), S. Fukao (Japan), E. Kudeki (USA),
and R. Woodman (Peru). Adherent to the International Steering Group
are the Chairpersons of the MST Radar Permanent Working Groups:
P. Chilson (USA), D.  Holdsworth (Australia), G. Nastrom (USA),
P.B. Rao (India), and M. Yamamoto (Japan).</P>
 
<P>Honorary Members of the Steering Group are: M.F. Larsen 
(USA), C.H. Liu (Taiwan), A.P. Mitra (India).</P>
 
<P>The National Organizing Committee of MST10 consists of: R.  Woodman
(Chair, IGP), J. Chau (ROJ-IGP), Antonio Mabres (UDEP) and M. Sarango
(Ciencia Internacional).</P>
 
<P>The Local Organizing Committee of MST10 consists of: Rodolfo Rodriguez
(Chair), William Ipanaque, and Sergio Balarezo.</P>
 
<P>The Scientific and Technical Program Committee will be established
before the circulation of the Second Circular.</P>
 
<P>The Tenth International Workshop on Technical and Scientific Aspects
of MST Radar - MST10 - is an activity sponsored by the Scientific
Committee on Solar Terrestrial Physics (SCOSTEP), the Instituto
Geofsico del Peru (IGP) and the Universidad de Piura (UDEP). Further
sponsors, such as URSI, Ciencia Internacional, and other agencies and
foundations are expected.</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Your name and affiliation
  <LI>Full mailing address
  <LI>Telephone and fax numbers including the international code
  <LI>e-mail address
  <LI>An indication whether you are planning to present paper(s)
  <LI>Potential topic of your paper(s)
</OL>

<P>The Second Circular of MST10, which will be distributed in October
2002, will contain details about abstract submissions, information
about the venue and logistics for the meeting.</P>
