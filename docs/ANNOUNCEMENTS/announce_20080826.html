<B>Data from a new surface met instrument - a Vaisala WXT510 - now
available through the BADC</B><BR> A Vaisala WXT510 Weather
Transmitter began operations at the NERC MST Radar site on 21st
December 2007. The data for each day are split into three separate
(netCDF) files owing to the fact that they are measured in independent
measurement cycles:

<DL>
  <DD><A href = "file_format_wxt510_ptu.html">Pressure, temperature and
  humidity</A>
  <DD><A href = "file_format_wxt510_precip.html">Rain (and hail) rate and
  accumulation</A>
  <DD><A href = "file_format_wxt510_wind.html">Wind speed and
  direction</A>
</DL>

More details about the instrument can be found <A
href="wxt510.html">here</A>. <BR><BR>

There have been a number of problems with the relative humidity and
rainfall sensors of the pre-existing Campbell Scientific data logger
- <A href="cgi-bin/mstlog_public/mst_event_search.py">see here for
more details</A>. The availability of measurements from a second set
of sensors will consequently provide a means of checking data
reliability. Moreover the new instrument samples surface met
parameters at 1 minute, rather than 10 minute, intervals.<BR><BR>

<B>Quick-look plots</B><BR>
No quick-look plots of wind data from the new instrument will be
created for the time
being. However, three new plot types will be created for the other
data products using the following file naming convention:

Note the slight change in file name format. These plots will be
available <A href="plots_access.html">in the same directory as
previously</A>. <BR><BR>
