<B>Problem with reliability flag values for v3 MST Radar radial data
files produced prior to 10th May 2007</B><BR> 

Owing to a bug in the file-writing software, v3 MST Radar radial data
files produced prior to 10th May 2007 do not not contain correct
reliability flag information, i.e. the variables:

<UL>
  <LI><FONT class="code_red">signal_component_is_reliable</FONT>
  <LI><FONT class="code_red">signal_component_reliability_details</FONT>
</UL>

only contain values of 0. The software was fixed on 10th May 2007 and
so files for data dates including and after 10th May 2007 are free
from this problem. Files for data dates prior to 10th May 2007 will
gradually be re-created. If you are uncertain as to whether or not you
have a corrected file, check the creation date which is recorded in
the netcdf global attribute <FONT
class="code_red">history</FONT>.<BR><BR>


<B>This problem does not affect v3 MST Radar Cartesian data files</B><BR> 
Since the reliability flags in the Cartesian files are used to
determine which data should be included in the quick-look plots, it is
known that they are not affected by the same problem.<BR><BR>
