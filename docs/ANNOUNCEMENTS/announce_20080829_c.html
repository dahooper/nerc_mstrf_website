<B>A paper on the v3 MST radar signal processing scheme is now in print</B><BR>

Users of MST radar data are advised to state, in their publications,
which version of the data products they have used (i.e. v0, v1, v2 or
v3). Each signal processing scheme has (slightly) different data
quality and reliability characteristics. It is important that readers
can establish what these characteristics are and whether or not they
are significant. The following paper can be referenced for this purpose:

The <B>Abstract</B> is as follows:<BR>
This paper describes a new signal processing scheme for the 46.5 MHz
Doppler Beam Swinging wind-profiling radar at Aberystwyth, in the
UK. Although the techniques used are similar to those already
described in literature - i.e. the identification of multiple signal
components within each spectrum and the use of radial- and
time-continuity algorithms for quality-control purposes - it is shown
that they must be adapted for the specific meteorological environment
above Aberystwyth. In particular they need to take into account the
three primary causes of unwanted signals: ground clutter,
interference, and Rayleigh scatter from hydrometeors under stratiform
precipitation conditions. Attention is also paid to the fact that
short-period gravity-wave activity can lead to an invalidation of the
fundamental assumption of the wind field remaining stationary over the
temporal and spatial scales encompassed by a cycle of
observation. Methods of identifying and accounting for such conditions
are described. The random measurement error associated with horizontal
wind components is estimated to be 3.0 - 4.0 m/s for single
cycle data. This reduces to 2.0 - 3.0 m/s for data averaged
over 30 minutes. The random measurement error associated with vertical
wind components is estimated to be 0.2 - 0.3 m/s. This cannot
be reduced by time-averaging as significant natural variability is
expected over intervals of just a few minutes under conditions of
short-period gravity-wave activity.
