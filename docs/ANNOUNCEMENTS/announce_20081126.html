<B>MST12 Workshop and Radar School - May 2008 - London, Ontario,
 Canada</B><BR>

The <A href="http://www.mst12.com">Twelfth International Workshop on
Technical and Scientific Aspects of MST Radar (MST12)</A> will be held:

<DL>
  <DD>Dates: 17 - 23 May 2009
  <DD>Location: London, Ontario, Canada
</DL>

which is the week before the <A
href="http://www.agu.org/meetings/ja09">American Geophysical Union
2009 Joint Assembly</A> (24 - 27 May), which will be held in Toronto -
only 200 km from London Ontario.<BR><BR>

The deadline for abstract submission is Friday 23rd January 2009.<BR><BR>

There will be a radar school immediately prior to the MST12 workshop:   
<DL>
  <DD>Dates: 12 - 16 May 2009
</DL>
which is intended for students, post-docs and anyone who is new to the
field. More details about the <A href="#workshop">workshop</A> and <A
href="#school">school</A> can be found below or through the <A
href="http://www.mst12.com">MST12 website</A>.<BR><BR>

     </UL>
</OL>


<A name="school">
<B>The Radar School</B><BR>
In addition to providing lectures on the topics shown below, the
school will involve a hands-on component. One day will be spent
visiting one of the 5 radars which are within 2-3 hours of the school
venue. This will give the students the opportunity to carry out different
experiments. There will subsequently be a data analysis session for
which the students are expected to bring their own laptop and data
analysis/plotting software (e.g. Matlab or IDL).

<UL>
  <LI>Radar types and design principles
  <LI>Scattering mechanisms
  <LI>Meteor radars - basic principles 
  <LI>Measurement techniques - Doppler, spaced antenna, etc
  <LI>Pulse-coding
  <LI>Spaced antenna methods, including interferometry 
  <LI>Data storage
  <LI>Gravity waves
  <LI>Meteorology with radar
  <LI>RASS, more advanced scattering
  <LI>Turbulence
  <LI>Antenna theory 
  <LI>MF methods, Differential Absorption
  <LI>Ionospheric applications of MST radars
