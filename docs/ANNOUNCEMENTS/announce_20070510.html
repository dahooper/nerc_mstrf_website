<B>Sky-camera images and laser ceilometer backscatter data now
available</B><BR> 

Since 25th April 2007, images from the new sky-camera at the MST Radar
site are being captured at 1 minute intervals. Full details of this
instrument, together will a sample image, can be found <A
href="sky-camera.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>

Since 24th April 2007, the laser ceilometer has been outputting
backscatter profiles in addition to the standard cloud base
information. The new data will not be made available through the BADC
until they have been rewritten into self-documented netCDF files (the
cloud base data are already available in NASA-Ames format
files). Please <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the NERC MST
Radar Facility Project Scientist</A> if you have an immediate need for
the backscatter data. Full details of this instrument, together will a
sample quick-look plots of both cloud base and backscatter data, can
be found <A href="laser_ceilometer.html">here</A>.<BR><BR>
