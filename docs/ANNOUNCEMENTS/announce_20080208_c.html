<B>Archiving of Aberporth high-resolution radiosonde data resumed by
the BADC</B><BR> 

The closest radiosonde launch site to the Aberystwyth MST radar
facility is at Aberporth airport, approximately 45 km to the SW. The
high resolution (2 s) data were archived by the British Atmospheric
Data Centre (BADC) for the period April 1990 - June 2001. The sondes tended
to be launched several times daily (often at 05, 11, 17, and 23 UT),
albeit on weekdays only. This site is not an official part of the Met
Office radiosonde network. Moreover, the Met Office's requirement for
radiosonde data from Aberporth has considerably reduced owing to the
availability of wind-profile data from the MST Radar at
Aberystwyth.<BR><BR>

There was a gap between June 2000 and June 2007 (with the exception of
two dates in 2006) when no high-resolution radiosonde data from
Aberporth were received by the BADC. During this time, the closest
radiosonde station was at Camborne, approximately 270 km to the
south. However, high-resolution data from Aberporth are once again
being made available. The archive tends to be updated once every two
months. <BR><BR>

The new data have already proved to be invaluable for determining the altitude
offset introduced by the new MST Radar control and data acquisition
system - <A href="announce_20080208.html">click here</A> for more
details. Radiosondes from Aberporth tend to pass close to the MST radar
site at mid-tropospheric altitudes - see, e.g. <A
href="publications_by_year.html#1997">Thomas et al. (1997)</A> for
more details. <BR><BR>
