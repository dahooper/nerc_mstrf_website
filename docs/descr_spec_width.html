<P>Although the spectral width contains information about the variance
of vertical velocities observed by the radar, i.e. the turbulence
intensity, in practice this is not the only, nor even necessarily the
most signficant, contribution. Beam broadening is a result of the
finite radar beam width and increases with increasing horizontal wind
speed. It can often be the dominant cause of spectral broadening,
particularly for wind speeds in excess of 30 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, hence
the lack of useful corrected spectral width data in the figure
above. The data here correspond to observations made by a vertically
directed beam; those made at off-vertical angles require additional
correction factors to be taken into account. The thin layer of
enhanced corrected spectral width around 6 km, between 1030 and 1300
UT, is apparantly related to the breaking of the mountain lee waves at
a critical layer and implies that the wave energy is being dissipated
through turbulence. The corresponding sharp rotation of the horizontal
wind vector shows up as a region of high shear. It is not so clear
what is causing the enhanced spectral widths prior to 1030 UT over a
more widespread altitude range.</P><BR>
