<B>Changes to the MST radar data acquisition system</B><BR>

A new MST Radar control and data acquisition system began operations
at 13:44 UT on 6th February 2007. The system is essentially a
recreation of the previous one, which was designed around a WindowsNT
PC and had been in operation since 1999. However, it does allow the
radar to be operated in a more flexible and reliable way. The switch
over to the new system has implications for the following:

<UL>
  <LI>The format of Doppler spectra files
  <LI>The availability of different versions of MST Radar data products
  <LI>Changes in signal and noise powers
</UL>

as described <A href="mstr_new_acquisition_system.html">on this
page</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>A switch of data weighting window in derivation of the  radar return Doppler spectra</B><BR>
Wind-profile statistics, provided the Met Office, for the first month
of operation (February 2007) indicate a slight (but noticeable)
reduction in data quality. It is suspected that the cause of this
change is the use of the Hanning data weighting window in deriving the
radar return Doppler spectra. Consequently a switch to use of the
Rectangular window (as used by the old data acquisition system) was
made at 07:32 UT on 2007/04/02.<BR><BR>

A discussion of the effects of different data weighting windows on
radar return signal parameters can be found in the following
publication:

<DL> 
  <DD>Hooper, D. A., Signal and noise level estimation for
    narrow spectral width returns observed by the Indian MST radar. 
   <I>Radio Sci., 34</I>, pp 859-870, 1999. 
</Dl>

The plots below show radar return Doppler spectra (in linear units in
the top panels and in logarithmic units in the bottom panels) for
spectra derived using the Hanning window (at 07:31:45 on 2007/04/02)
and for spectra derived using a Rectangular window (at 07:32:34 on
2007/04/02). <BR><BR>

As expected, the <A href="#Rectangular">Rectangular window spectra</A>
show signs of spectral leakage - apparent as horizontal banding in the
Power Spectra Densities (PSDs) in dB units (i.e. bottom panel) at
ranges of around around 2.5, 5.5, 10.5 and 12.0 km. This causes the
noise level to be overestimated for spectra with the largest peak
PSDs. It is for this reason that the Cartesian data files record only
the median noise power over all range gates, thereby avoiding
contamination from individual overestimates. However, by way of
compensation, the effects of dc contamination in Rectangular window
spectra can be corrected by replacing the PSD of only the central
velocity bin. By contrast, it is necessary to replace the PSDs of the
three central velocity bin to remove dc contamination from <A
href="#Hanning">Hanning window spectra</A>. This is apparent as a
blocky-ness of the central PSDs in linear units (i.e. the top
panel). <BR><BR>

It was thought that the effects of dc correction for the Hanning
window spectra would lead only to a slight degradation of the quality
of vertical velocities which are close to zero. It should be noted
that vertical velocities are more often than not close to zero, which
is the reason that this effect is now thought to be the cause of the
reduction in horizontal wind data quality. It should also be noted
that the version 3 signal processing software was developed to take
into account the effects of spectral leakage in Rectangular window
spectra. This change from the use of the Hanning window back to use of
the Rectangular window should not consequently lead to a further
reduction in data quality. It will be necessary to wait until the Met
Office release wind profile statistics for April 2007 (expected in
mid-May) before it is possible to say whether or not the choice of
data weighting window really has been the cause of the change in data
quality.
