title: NERC MSTR acquisition system
---

A new MST Radar control and data acquisition system began operations
at 13:44 UT on 6th February 2007. The system is essentially a
recreation of the previous one, which was designed around a WindowsNT
PC and had been in operation since 1999. However, it does allow the
radar to be operated in a more flexible and reliable way. The switch
over to the new system has a number of implications for use of data
collected after 6th February 2007:<BR><BR>

<B>Doppler spectra files</B><BR> Owing to the relatively limited data
storage capacity available when the MST radar was built in 1989, the
<A href="file_format_v0_ds_dah.html">Doppler spectra files</A> were
designed with volume minimisation in mind. Power spectral density
values were pre-compressed so that they could be stored within just 8
bits. However, the format of these files is non-standard and some
effort is required to implement appropriate decompression routines. <A
href="file_format_mstr_spectra_netcdf.html">Doppler spectra from the
new acquisition system</A> are stored in standard netCDF files making
them much easier to access.<BR><BR>


<B>Availability of different versions of MST Radar data products</B><BR>
Version-0 (v0) and version-2 (v2) signal processing programs were both
designed specifically to operate on the old-style Doppler spectral
files. Since version-3 (v3) processing (which was introduced in
January 2006) has been demonstrated to be superior to both v0 and v2
processing, it was the only one modified to operate on Doppler
spectral files produced by the new acquisition system. Consequently no
v0 or v2 data products are available for dates after 6th February
2007.<BR><BR>

<B>Changes in signal and noise powers for observations made after 6th February
2007</B><BR>
There is a step change of +61.7 dB in signal and noise powers for
observations made after 6th February 2007. This is because the power
spectral densities are no longer being re-scaled in order to aid data
volume compression (as mentioned above). Noise and signal levels are
affected equally. The plot below shows the diurnal variations in the
median noise power (over vertical-beam ST-mode profiles) for 5th and
7th February 2007. The time variations are primarily a result of
changes in the (46.5 MHz) cosmic noise, which explains the extremely
high degree of correlation between the two curves. The same pattern of
variation is repeated at a slightly earlier time each day in a cycle
over the course of a year.<BR><BR>

The magnitude of the offset was calculated by regression analysis as
shown in the plot below. The best fit line was constrained to have a
slope of 1.0, though a free fit results in a value slightly closer to
1.1 (as is evident in the time series curves above).
