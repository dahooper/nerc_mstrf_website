<B>CORRECTION TO LASER CEILOMETER CLOUD BASE ALTITUDE FILES (8th - 27th JANUARY
2010)</B><BR> The Vaisala LD40 laser ceilometer developed an internal
fault at 20:48 UT on 3rd January 2010, which prevented it from making
observations. The problem cleared by itself at 21:42 UT on 4th January
but re-occurred at 00:29 UT on 8th January, lasting until 13:23 UT of
the same day. The cause of the problem is not known.<BR><BR>

In connection with this problem, the LD40's internal clock, which is
used to generate the time stamps for the data messages, suddenly
jumped to from 13:23 UT to 03:05 UT on 8th January (the date stamp
subsequently became corrupted). This resulted in the time stamps being
in error in all cloud base altitude files, and their corresponding
quick look plots, 8th - 27th January 2010. This problem was corrected
in software on 29th January 2010 and all BADC files (and quick-look
plots) for the affected period have now been regenerated. <BR><BR>

If you have made use of any of the cloud base altitude files from this
period, please <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the NERC MST
Radar Facility Project Scientist</A> if you have any further
questions.
