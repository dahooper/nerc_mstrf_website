<P>Except in cases of convection or short horizontal wavelength
gravity wave activity, (absolute) atmospheric vertical velocities tend
to be of the order of only a few cm s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is within the
margin of error of the radar measurements and so it is only in the
case of at least moderate vertical velocity activity, i.e. of the
order of a few 10's of cm s<SUP>-1</SUP> or greater, that the
measurements can be considered to be representative of actual
atmospheric motion. Vertical velocities measured by the NERC MST Radar
tend, as in this case, to be dominated by mountain lee wave
activity. The strongest wave actvity is expected when the low-level
wind is from between the North and South through East, i.e. from the
directions in which the mountains are situated.</P>

<P>The lowest panel in the figure above shows the low-level wind
direction (in the meteorological convention, i.e. the direction FROM
WHICH the wind is blowing) measured at (blue line) `surface level',
i.e. by the wind tower at Frongoch</A>, and at altitudes of (green)
0.78 km, (red) 1.17 km and (black) 1.55 km measured by the 915 MHz Met
Office boundary-layer wind-profiler which was operated at the NERC MST
Radar site between 1999 and 2002. The boundary-layer wind-profiler
data (at 30 minute intervals) are particularly patchy prior to 0500 UT
and after 2000 UT; the surface data (at 1 minute intervals) have been
smoothed by a 10 minute running mean. As can be seen between 0900 and
1800 UT, the horizontal wind vector at the lowest level observed by
the MST radar, i.e. around 2 km, can, in general, be taken as proxy
for the low-level wind; in practice the wind vector within the lowest
km or so of the atmosphere rotates approximately 20&deg; - 30&deg;
anti-clockwise (in the Northern Hemisphere) with decreasing altitude
(when viewed from above) owing to the increasing effects of frictional
drag.  However, prior to 0900 UT there is a marked directional shear
with altitude (~180&deg;) and so the lowest-level wind vector inferred
from the MST Radar observations bears no relation to the lower-level
flow. The sharp rotation of the horizontal wind vector can clearly be
traced at progressively higher levels as a function of time; first at
the surface level around 0100 UT, at 0.78 km around 0400 UT, at 1.17
km around 0530 UT and at 1.55 km around 0700 UT, and then up through
the MST Radar observations from 2 km around 0800 UT to 7 km around
1200 UT.</P>

<P>In fact the changes in the lee wave activity observed by the MST
Radar in this particular case have more to do with the rotations of
the horizontal wind vector above 2 km than those below it. Significant
mountain wave activity is apparant in the vertical velocities at the
lowest levels from at least 0600 UT. The reason that the vertical
propagation of the waves is restricted prior to 1230 UT appears to be
the presence of critical layers, i.e. where the horizontal wind vector
has rotated &gt; 90&deg; relative to that at the wave forcing
level. It will be shown in connection with the spectral widths that
this is causing the wave energy to be dissipated as
turbulence.</P><BR>
