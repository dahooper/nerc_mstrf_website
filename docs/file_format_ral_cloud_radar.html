title: File format for RAL cloud radar data
---


The files contain altitude profiles (typically from 0 - 16 km) of the
(Rayleigh scattered) radar return signal power. These have neither
been range corrected nor converted into cloud products. Data are
typically recorded at intervals of 30 m in altitude and 30 s in
time.<BR> <A href="file_contents.html">Click here</A> to find out

<B>Data availability:</B><BR>
Data are available from April 2005 until June 2006. There are a
number of gaps in the dataset Refer to <A

<B>Data availability</B><BR> 
Data are available from 14th April 2005 onwards. However, because the
instrument was not designed with an active cooling system, it must be
switched off during hot weather to prevent overheating. Data are not
therefore available on a continuous basis. The instrument is likely to
remain at the MST radar site until at least September 2005.<BR><BR>

<A name = "format">
<B>File format</B><BR> 
Although there are long-term plans to rewrite the data in
standard-format files, at present they are only available in the
original (non-standard format) files, which are nevertheless easy to
read. Users should note that the data were acquired on an AppleMac,
which uses a different end-of-line character to that used for
Linux/Unix and Windows systems. Although this should not present a
problem for reading the data into a program, some text editors will
show the file contents on a single line. <A
href="#eol_character">Click here</A> for more details on how to
overcome this problem.<BR><BR>

Each file contains 3 header lines beginning with a "#". These do not
contain any information required for reading the data and so can
simply be ignored. The spacings of the header lines for file <FONT
class="code_black">20050414-01.crd</FONT>, shown below, have been
modified for ease of viewing, and the third line has been shown split
across two lines:

<PRE><FONT class="code_green">
#RCR - RAL Cloud Radar Data File, Version 4, (log scan data)
#Location: MST Radar Site, Capel Dewi
#Date   Time   Range (km)   Averaging   Sky Temp. (K)   Temp. Mon.
   Status   <512 tab-separated Scan Data Points></FONT></PRE>

Each subsequent line then contains a single profile of radar return
signal powers together with the relevant observation parameters, all
tab-separated ("\t"). The beginning of the first data line for file <FONT
class="code_black">20050414-01.crd</FONT> is shown in green, with
descriptors (which do not appear in the file) shown in red:

<PRE><FONT class="code_green">14/4/05   16:15:15   8   1200   -11962.1    -261.7   1   -98.19    -97.79 . . .</FONT><FONT class="code_red">
 D/M/YY   hh:mm:ss   MR  NAV     SKY         INT     ST   P1        P2
</PRE>

<DL>where
  <DD><FONT class="code_red">D/M/YY</FONT> gives the UTC day [1 - 31],
  month [1 - 12], and 2-digit zero-padded year [00 - 99] of the
  profile. The day and month are not zero padded<BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">hh:mm:ss</FONT> gives the UTC 2-digit
    zero-padded hour [00 - 23], minute [00 - 59] and second [00 - 59]
    of the profile.<BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">MR</FONT> gives the maximum range (km)
    from the radar [8, 16 or 32] for data recorded in this
    profile. There are always 512 data points in a profile, so the
    range (km) from the radar for a given data point number, <FONT
    class="code_red">point_nr</FONT> [1 - 512], is given by
    <BR><CENTER><FONT class="code_red">point_nr/512 *
    MR</FONT></CENTER> Since the radar is located at 50 m above mean
    sea level, 0.05 km must be added to the range values to give
    altitude. Care should taken since not all profiles within a given
    file necessarily share the same value of <FONT
    class="code_red">MR</FONT>. When the radar shuts down
    unexpectedly, its default mode on reboot is to interlace 16 and 32
    km observations.<BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">NAV</FONT> gives the number of chirps
  averaged together to give this profile.<BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">SKY</FONT> gives the sky temperature
  measured by the receiver when the transmitter is off. However, it
  should be ignored as it is completely uncalibrated.<BR><BR> 

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">INT</FONT> gives the internal
  temperature. However, the monitor is not working at the
  moment.<BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">ST</FONT> gives the instrument
  status. This number can be ignored. <BR><BR>

  <DD><FONT class="code_red">P1, P2 . . . P512</FONT> give the 512
  range-sampled radar return signal powers (dB). Note that:<BR>
  <CENTER>P_dB = 10 &times; log10[P_linear]</CENTER> The powers have
  not been range-corrected although they have been scaled according to
  some instrument parameters, such as output power, receiver
  sensitivity and antenna gain.

</DL>

Where more than one file exists for a day, the files can be simply 
concatenated and then read with a routine of the form: 
<PRE><FONT class="code_red">while not EOF
  read line
  if line does not start with a "#"
    extract observation parameters and power profile from line
  end 
end</FONT></PRE>

The data volume of these files is rather large. Although this is not a
problem for profiles separated at 30 s intervals, when the radar shuts
down unexpectedly, its default mode on reboot is to record profiles at
10 s intervals. If this causes memory problems for a file reading
routine, the simplest solution is to only store data from every third
profile.<BR><BR>

<A name="eol_character">
<B>End-Of-Line Character Issues</B><BR> 

The end-of-line character is a carriage return ("\r" or decimal 13) on
an AppleMac, a line feed ("\n" or decimal 10) on Linux/Unix, but a
carriage return plus a line feed on Windows. A file reading program
shouldn't have a problem with this issue and even some text editors,
such as Emacs, are able to recognise that the file is of Mac origin and
to display it appropriately. However, other text editors, such as vi,
effectively display the file as one continuous line.<BR><BR>

The following BASH script will automatically create new files with the
appropriate EOL character on a Linux/Unix system. The new files have
the extension "crdu" and the original files are left untouched.

<PRE><FONT class="code_red">#!/bin/bash
# Shell script to convert AppleMac EOL characters to Linux/Unix EOL
# characters for RAL cloud radar data files. It leaves the original
# files, with extensions "crd", as they are and creates new files
# with extensions "crdu".
#
# Intructions for use:
# 1) Cut and paste this script to file, e.g. "convert.bash", in
#    the directory where the original files are found
#
# 2) Make the script executable, e.g. with the command: 
#      chmod 750 convert.bash
#
# 3) Run the script with the command: 
#      ./convert.bash
#
for orig_name in *.crd
do
  new_name=${orig_name}u
  echo Converting $orig_name to $new_name
  tr "\r" "\n" < $orig_name > $new_name
done
