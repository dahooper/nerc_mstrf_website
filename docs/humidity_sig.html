<P>The radar return signal power is influenced by (amoungst other
factors) both the specific humidity and its vertical gradient. These
factors can be significant right the way up to the tropopause level
but, in general, are confined to altitudes below approximately 8
km. As can be seen from the examples above, the `humidity signature'
typically shows a great deal of small scale structure (particularly so
in the case of the middle panel) and its magnitude is highly
variable. Although it is not, in general, possible to decipher this
signature based on radar return signal power alone, it seems likely
that it could be of use for (at least) certain cases when
complementary information is available. This is a topic of on-going
research. Precipitation can additionally give rise to a distinctive
signature in the radar return signal power.</P><BR>
