Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC).<BR><BR>

The following have been identified as being particularly useful to
complement observations made by the NERC MST Radar - click on the
title to go to the relevant page on the BADC.<BR><BR>

<A href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/rad-highres"><B>Met Office
high resolution radiosonde data</B></A><BR>
The data consist of vertical profiles of pressure, temperature,
relative humidity, humidity mixing ratio, sonde position, wind speed
and wind direction. Measurements are taken at 2 second intervals and
the ascents extend to heights of approximately 20 - 30 km. Of
particular relevance to the NERC MST radar observations are those
radiosondes launched from Aberporth, approximately 45 km to the
south-west of Aberystwyth. <BR><BR><BR>


<A href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/ukmo-wind-prof"><B>Met Office
Wind-Profilers</B></A><BR> Data are available from the Met Office's
boundary-layer wind-profilers located at Camborne, Dunkeswell and
Wattisham and (formerly) Aberystwyth. The primary data products are 30
minute consensus average profiles of wind speed and direction. Radial
velocities and signal-to-noise ratios for individual beam
directions are also given. Observations are made in both a "low" mode,
covering the approximate altitude range 0.1 - 2.0 km at 0.1 km
intervals, and a "high" mode, covering the approximate altitude range
0.2 - 8.0 km at 0.2 km intervals; the useful coverage varies with
atmospheric conditions.<BR>

Rain Radar (Nimrod)</B></A><BR>
Nimrod is a fully automated system for weather analysis and nowcasting
based around a network of C-band rainfall radars. It provides
fine-resolution analyses and six-hour forecasts. The BADC holds the
analyses as a time resolution of 15 minutes. Nimrod delivers routine
predictions of: Rainfall rate, Rain accumulation, Precipitation type,
Snow probability, Cloud, Visibility and Wind gust speeds. Quick-look
plots of the data are also available.
