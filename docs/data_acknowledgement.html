title: 'NERC MSTRF: acknowledging use of data'
---

Use of data from the NERC MST Radar Facility is covered by the <A href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">Open Government Licence</A>. The principal condition of use is that the source of the
    data MUST be appropriately acknowledged.<BR><BR>

Where the data from any of the Facility's instruments have been used in a
publication, the dataset should be cited in a similar way to an academic
article, i.e. by including a reference in the main body of the text (this could
be in the Acknowledgements section) in one of the following two forms:

<OL>
  <LI>Natural Environment Research Council (<I>Year-of-citation</I>)<BR><BR>
  <LI>NERC (<I>Year-of-citation</I>)<BR>
</OL>

and with a corresponding entry in the bibliography/references section of the
form:<BR>

<DL>
  <DD>Natural Environment Research Council, Aberystwyth Radar Facility,
[Hooper, D.]. The NERC Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere (MST) Radar
Facility at Aberystwyth, [Internet]. British Atmospheric Data Centre, 2006-,
<I>Date-of-citation</I>. Available from
http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/mst.<BR>
</DL>

where <I>Date-of-citation</I> is the date on which the
files were downloaded in YYYY-MM-DD format. If files were downloaded at
different times, the date of the last download can be
used. <I>Year-of-citation</I> is simply the year part
of <I>Date-of-citation</I>.<BR><BR>

Data users are requested to <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">send
  the details of such publications to the Facility's Project
  Scientist</A>. These will be added to
the <A href="publications.html">Facility's publication list</A>.
