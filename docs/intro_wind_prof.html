<P>Wind-profiling radar systems can be designed to operate at
frequencies anywhere between 40 and 1400 MHz. In practice, however,
they are restricted to frequencies around 50, 400 and 1000 MHz; the
principles of operation are similar in all three cases. The most
common technique is known as Doppler Beam Swinging (DBS) which
involves making observations in a cyclic sequence of vertical and
near-vertical beam pointing directions. The 'targets', from which
small fractions of the pulsed radar signals are returned, are
irregularities of atmospheric refractive index, which cause
back-scattering (so-called 'clear-air' returns), and hydrometeors,
which give rise to Rayleigh scaterring. The scattered signal is
Doppler-shifted according to the radial component of the target's
velocity, i.e. that along the radar beam pointing direction. In order
to derive the full three-dimensional wind vector, observations must
therefore be made in a minimum of 3 non-coplanar beam pointing
directions; a typical sequence includes observations made in the
vertical direction and at an off-vertical angle of between 5&deg; and
20&deg; in two orthogonal azimuths. Profiling is achieved by sampling
the radar return signals as a function of delay from the time of the
transmitted pulse; the transmitted pulse length determines the range
resolution.</P>

<P>The choice of radar operating frequency has a number of important
consequences:</P>

<DL>
  <DD><B>Significance of the vertical velocity: </B>at frequencies
  around 50 MHz, although strong precipitation is detectable,
  clear-air returns always dominate over hydrometeor returns; at
  around 400 MHz hydrometeor returns dominate for anything more than
  light rain; at around 1000 MHz hydrometeor returns dominate whenever
  precipitation is present. Since hydrometeors only share the
  horizontal components of velocity with the wind, it is not always
  possible to determine the vertical velocity of the atmosphere from
  observations made at frequencies around 400 and 1000 MHz; the
  vertical velocities derived from the radar observations represent
  the fall-speeds of the hydrometeors.<BR><BR>

  <B>Antenna dimensions: </B>in order to restrict the horizontal
  extent from which radar signals are returned, wind-profiling systems
  require narrow angular beam widths; 1&deg; corresponds to 175 m at a
  range of 10 km. The beam width is related (inversely proportional)
  to both the horizontal dimensions of the antenna and the frequency
  of operation. For 50 MHz radars, typical antenna dimensions and
  (one-way half-power half-) beam-widths are of the order of 100 m and
  1.5&deg;, respectively; for 400 MHz radars they are 10 m and 3&deg;,
  respectively; for 1000 MHz radars they are 2 m and 5&deg;,
  respectively. Largely for reasons of cost, antenna arrays (composed
  of a large number of individual aerials) are used rather than
  steerable parabolic dishes; beam steering is achieved electronically
  by altering the phase of the signals fed to and from different parts
  of the array.<BR><BR>

  <B>The maximum observable altitude: </B>this decreases with
  increasing frequency and is typically 20 km at 50 MHz, 10 km at 400
  MHz and 3 km at 1000 MHz. It is determined in part by the nature of
  the scattering mechanisms and in part by a combination of the
  transmitter power and antenna dimensions. The minimum observable
  altitude also decreases with increasing frequency and is typically 2
  km at 50 MHz, 0.5 km at 400 MHz and 0.1 km at 1000 MHz; this is
  determined largely by the differences in hardware design at the
  different frequencies. For the above reasons, profilers operating
  around 50 and 400 MHz are called Stratosphere-Troposphere (ST)
  radars (or MST radars in the case of 50 MHz radars which are
  sufficiently powerful to detect the sporadic and weak returns from
  the Mesosphere), whereas those operating around 1000 MHz are called
  boundary-layer wind-profilers.<BR><BR>

  <B>The variability of altitude coverage as a function of
  time:</B> owing to the fact that hydrometeor returns become
  increasingly significant with increasing radar frequency, the
  maximum observable altitude at 1000 MHz can increase suddenly from 3
  to 8 km with the onset of precipitation. Moreover, the wind-profiles
  can be discontinuous even below 3 km owing to the fact that radar
  return signals at these frequencies can contain contributions from a
  number of unwanted targets such as insects, birds, aircraft, trees
  and power lines; the latter two are detected through the beam's
  sidelobes and so do not need to be located along the main lobe's
  pointing direction. At 50 MHz the only unwanted targets are aircraft
  and the changes in altitude coverage at are far less dramatic. The
  radar return power typically decreases with increasing altitude and
  the signals are often close to the point of detectability within the
  15 - 20 km altitude region leading to discontinuities in the
  wind-profiles. The radar return power typically shows a step
  increase at the tropopause level and the signals can also be on the
  point of detectability just below this, especially when the
  tropopause is above 11 km.

</DL>
<P>Wind profiler radar returns are parameterised by their signal
powers and spectral widths (i.e. the variance of scatterer velocities
about the mean) in addition to their Doppler shifts. This information can
be used, under certain circumstances, to provide additional
information about the atmospheric static stability (thus allowing
monitoring of the altitude and sharpness of the tropopause), humidity
fields and turbulence (of at least moderate intensity).</P>
