title: 'NERC MSTRF: Where and when can Noctilucent Clouds (NLCs) be seen'
---

<p><a href="nlcs_what-are-they.html">Noctilucent Clouds (NLCs)</a> can
potentially be seen from anywhere within the British Isles, i.e. from
the latitude band between 50° and 60° N.</p>

<p>The extraordinarily cold temperatures (below -125°C) required for
ice crystals to form occur almost daily between late May and early
August at latitudes above 65°N. The further south you are, the less
frequently they occur and the shorter the NLC season will be. It is
rare for NLCs to extend below 53° N and it is exceptional for them to
extend below 50° N. Nevertheless, because of their high altitude (82
km) they can be seen from up to 7° further south (approximately 800 km
away). They will be at a very low elevation angle from this
distance. The further north you are, the higher they will appear in
the sky. The map above shows the potential location of NLCs for an
observer at
the <a href="https://amof.ac.uk/observatory/chilbolton-atmospheric-observatory-cao/">Chilbolton
Atmospheric Observatory (CAO)</a> (51.15°N). For an observer at a
higher latitude, the whole pattern simply shifts north.</p>

<p>Since the atmosphere is so thin at the altitude where NLCs form
(the pressure and density are approximately one hundred thousandth of
their sea level values), NLCs are too insubstantial to be seen against
the brightness of the sunlit lower atmosphere. They can only be seen
during twilight hours, when the Sun is at least 6° below the
horizon. They can remain directly illuminated by the Sun until it is
approximately 16° below the horizon. At this low solar elevation
angle, only the NLCs close to the horizon will be illuminated. NLCs at
higher elevation angles will only be apparent when the solar elevation
angle is closer to 6° below the horizon.</p>

<p>The further north you are, the less dark the mid-summer night sky
becomes. At Lerwick in the Shetland Islands (61.16°N), the sky only
just becomes dark enough to make NLCs visible on the night of the
summer solstice (which occurs on 21st or 22nd June). The minimum solar
elevation angle is slightly lower at all latitudes at the beginning
and the end of the NLC season. This means that the solar elevation
angle drops below 16° during the middle of the night for observers in
southern England (51.15°N is the latitude of the
<a href="https://amof.ac.uk/observatory/chilbolton-atmospheric-observatory-cao/">Chilbolton
Atmospheric Observatory (CAO)</a> where the NLC Camera is located. At
higher latitudes, if you are lucky you might be able to see NLCs
continuously between dusk and dawn. However, it is more common for
them to be visible during the dawn only.</p>

<p>The times at which the solar elevation angle is within the
potential range for NLCs to be visible vary with latitude (and to a
lesser extent with date and longitude). You will be able to find this
information from a number of online resources, including
the <a href="http://astro.ukho.gov.uk/websurf/">HM Nautical Almanac
Office’s Websurf utility</a>, for which you will need to choose the
Alt_Az option.</p>

<p>The biggest limitations you will have for seeing NLCs are:
<ul>
  <li>the weather – clouds in the lower atmosphere can obscure your view</li>
  <li>the fact that NLCs do not always extend sufficiently far south
  to be visible from the British
  Isles. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/daily-daisy/index.html">NASA
  produces daily images of NLC occurrence from observations made by
  their Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite</a>. There
  is a delay of a few days before these become available.</li>
