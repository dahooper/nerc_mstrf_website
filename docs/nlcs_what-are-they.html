title: 'NERC MSTRF: What are Noctilucent Clouds (NLCs) and Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSEs)'
---

Noctilucent Clouds (NLCs) are a seasonal wonder of the natural world.
They can only be seen from upper-middle and high latitudes during the
mid-summer months (between mid May and mid August in the northern
hemisphere). They are the result of ice crystals forming at the
extraordinarily high altitude of 82 km. This is 70 km higher than
virtually all other clouds seen at these latitudes and qualifies as
being at the edge of space (the atmospheric density and pressure are
approximately 100,000th of their values at sea level). NLCs can only
be seen during twilight hours – hence the name noctilucent, which means
night-shining. They are referred to as Polar Mesospheric Clouds (PMCs)
when they are observed by satellite-borne instruments.

The vast majority (98%) of atmospheric water vapour is confined to the
troposphere (which occupies approximately the lowest 12 km of the 
atmosphereat middle and upper latitudes). The overlying stratosphere 
(which occurs between altitudes of approximately 12 and 50 km) and
mesosphere (approximately 50 to 90 km) are extremely dry, containing
water vapour concentrations of below 10 parts per million by volume (ppmv).
Nevertheless, during the mid-summer months the altitude where NLCs form
becomes extraordinarily cold (and slightly more humid) as a result of
air rising (and cooling adiabatically) over the summer polar region. Ice
crystals can form where the temperature drops below a frost point of
approximately -125 °C.

The ice crystals can only be seen as NLCs if they grow larger than a few
tens of nanometres (nm) in size. This requires the cold conditions to
extend over a depth of at least several kilometres and there being
sufficient water vapour available. Even if the ice crystals do not grow
sufficiently large to be visible, they can give rise to the radar
phenomenon of Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSEs).
