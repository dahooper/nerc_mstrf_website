<B>Sky-camera event-log and animation software now available</B><BR> 
A work experience student, working with David Hooper, has created an
event-log for all sky-camera observations made between 25th April 2007
and 29th June 2007. This covers instances of the following: daybreak,
sunset, nightfall, mountain wave activity, Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities, dying cumulus, cirrus, mist, rain, rainbows, contrails,
counter-flows, the passage of the Moon and planets, insects,
crepuscular rays and aesthetically-pleasing scenes. <A

for access to the event-log.

Software for creating animations of sky-camera images, together with a
sample animation, have also been made available through the
website. These animations can be viewed using a standard web
browser. <A href="sky-camera_animation.html">Click here</A> for more
