<!*** beginning of page contents ***>

The sky-camera event-log records the start and stop date-times of
interesting phenomena seen in the 1-minute interval images. It currently
covers the period 25th April 2007 - 3rd August 2008. We are grateful to Joseph
Prentice, Emily Mackintosh, Daniel Khosla, Kathryn Stone, Kieran Cook, 
Natasha Bierrum, and Amelia Gilio, who contributed to the log whilst
undertaking work experience placements at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.<BR><BR>

Examples of phenomena identified in the log:
<DL>
  <DD><B>Daybreak </B>i.e. when it has become light enough for the
  images to be of use<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Sunset </B>i.e. when the Sun disappears beyond the horizon<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Nightfall </B>i.e. when it has become too dark for the images
  to be of use<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Mountain waves </B>i.e. cloud features which remain
  quasi-stationary relative to the landscape. These include the
  classic burger-shaped lenticular clouds, which are generated by air
  flow over an isolated hill. However, they are more often
  hot-dog-shaped clouds, which are generated by air flow over a
  ridge. This category probably also includes fair-weather cumulus
  clouds which are preferentially formed in particular
  locations.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Kelvin-Helmholtz Instabilities (KHIs) </B>i.e. clouds which
  are characterised by a number of parallel bands. They can be similar
  in appearance to some mountain-wave clouds, but they have shorter
  horizontal wavelengths - typically just a few km. KHI patterns can
  often be seen in mountain wave clouds.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Active cumulus </B>i.e. clouds which show considerable changes
  in vertical extent/structure from one image/minute to the next.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Dying cumulus </B>i.e. active cumulus which is
  evaporating.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Cirrus </B>i.e. high, thin cloud.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Mist </B>i.e. ground level cloud.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Rain </B>i.e. rain is falling<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Rainbow </B>i.e. a rainbow is visible<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Contrails </B>i.e. long, thin trails formed behind
  aircraft. These act as tracers of the wind.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Counterflow </B>i.e. the clouds/contrails are moving in
  different (nominally counter) directions at different heights.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Moon </B>i.e. the Moon is seen in the image. The camera
  auto-adjusts to the light level and so the Moon becomes more blurred
  after nightfall. <BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Planet </B>i.e. Venus or Saturn is seen in the images. These
  are not very large but can be seen to follow a well-defined path
  from one image to the next. <BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Insect </B>i.e. an insect is sitting directly in front of the
  camera. These are, in fact, typically spiders, which tend to move in 
  spiral patterns around their webs. <BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Crepuscular rays </B>i.e. radial bands of light/shadow
  radiating from the Sun.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Aesthetic </B>i.e. something working looking at simply
  because it looks good.<BR><BR>
