<B>Documentation on the version-3 MST Radar signal processing scheme
now available</B><BR> 

David Hooper, the MST Radar Facility Project Scientist, has recently
(October 2007) submitted a manuscript on the validation of the
version-3 (v3) MST Radar signal processing scheme to Annales
Geophysicae. He is awaiting referees' comments. This manuscript
covers the following.

<UL>
  <LI>the identification of multiple signal components within each
  radar return Doppler spectrum
  gate
  <LI>the principal causes of contamination observed by the
  Aberystwyth MST radar
  <LI>the use of radial-continuity, time-continuity, and
  complementary-beam-continuity algorithms for quality control
  <LI>a comparison of the quality of the wind-profile data produced by
  the v0 and v3 processing schemes
</UL>
