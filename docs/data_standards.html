Where the use of a dataset is restricted to a small group of
individuals, the choice of file format can be arbitrary. As long as
the structure of the file and the nature of the contents are known to
everyone concerned, a simple sequence of numbers (without any header
information) can be perfectly acceptable. However, the adoption of a
commonly-used, self-describing file format will greatly increase the
ease with which the data can be accessed by a wider community. This is
also essential for the long term preservation of the data. Files whose
formats are not adequately-documented (or self-evident) will become
useless as soon as there is a break in the continuity of people using
them. However, even if the files can be read, the contents might not
be scientifically valuable unless something is known about the
characteristics of the data products. Consequently it is important
that files contain an appropriate amount of metadata, i.e. information
necessary to interpret, understand and use the data.

<B>File formats recommended by the British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC)</B>
<BR>

The BADC hold a large number of datasets which encompass a variety of
file formats. The two formats most recommended for new datasets are:

<UL>
  <LI>NASA-Ames - a family of ASCII-based formats 
  <LI>netCDF - a binary for which access routines are freely available 
</UL>
 
NASA-Ames formats have been used for some of the NERC MST Radar
Facility datasets. However, the newest file types are in netCDF


Other pices of information which may aid in establishing the
usefulness of a resurrected dataset include details of:

<UL>
  <LI>the person or organisation responsible for collecting and
  recording the data. 
  <LI>a list (and, ideally, copies) of the publications relevant to
  the data. This can extend beyond refereed papers to include, for example,
  internal technical reports, minutes of meetings,  
  made use of the data 
  <LI>
</UL>
