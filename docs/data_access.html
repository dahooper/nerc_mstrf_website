title: 'NERC MSTRF: access to the data'
---

In keeping
with <A href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/sites/data/policy.asp">NERC's
  open access data policy</A>:

<UL>
  <LI>anyone may have free access to the NERC MST Radar Facility
    dataset<BR><BR> 

  <LI>the data may be used for any purpose, including a commercial
    one<BR><BR> 

  <LI>use of the data is covered by
    the <A href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">Open Government Licence</A><BR><BR> 

  <LI>the principal condition of use is
    that <A href="data_acknowledgement.html">the source of the data MUST be
      appropriately acknowledged</A> 

</UL>

The data will typically be made available through the British Atmospheric Data
Centre (BADC) within 36 hours of acquisition. This allows time for processing
and for collation of the data into 24 hour blocks. Longer delays may
occasionally occur as a result of technical problems. <BR><BR> 

The open access data policy only applies to the Facility's
standard data products, i.e. to the files made available through the BADC on
the time scales indicated above. Where possible, the Facility will also provide
non-standard data products - e.g. data extracted from the standard files but
made available in an alternative format, data derived from non-standard
processing, and data made available in near-real time. You will be required to
submit an Application for Facility Support and commercial rates may apply for
non-academic projects.

<A name="afs">
<H2>Application for Facility Support (AFS)</H2>

All users of the Facility's data are strongly encouraged to submit an
Application for Facility Support (AFS). It is only by being able to report to
NERC on the projects it supports that the Facility is able to ensure
continued funding. <BR><BR> 

It is only obligatory to submit an AFS if you require:
<UL>
  <LI><I>User Support</I>: you require any interaction with the Facility's
    Project Scientist e.g. for help with accessing, analysing, or
    interpreting the standard data products or for the provision of
    non-standard data products<BR><BR> 

  <LI><I>Campaign Support</I>: you require the Facility to support an
    observation campaign<BR><BR>
    
  <LI><I>Instrument Support</I>: you require the Facility to host a piece of
    guest equipment

</UL>

Before submitting an AFS, you
should <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the Facility's Project
  Scientist</A> to check whether the desired support can be provided. <BR><BR>


Data users who have not applied for Facility Support should not expect
direct help with anything beyond the most trivial of
enquiries. They must rely solely on the online resources. They simply need to
