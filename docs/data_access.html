title: 'NERC MSTRF: access to the data'
---

In keeping with NERC's open access data policy</A>:

<ul>
  <li>anyone may have free access to the NERC MST Radar Facility dataset</li>
  <li>use of the data is covered by
    the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">(UK) Open Government Licence</a></li> 
  <li>the data may be used for any purpose, including a commercial one</li>
  <li>the principal condition of use is that <a href="data_acknowledgement.html">the
    source of the data MUST be appropriately acknowledged</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The data will typically be made available through the 
<a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bd095d86e4a9f0c706b08058dbad3b31">Centre
  for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA)</a> within 36 hours of acquisition. This allows
  time for final quality control checks to be carried out. The release of data will
  be delayed over weekends, when the facility manager is on leave, or when there are
  technical problems with the data delivery.</p>

<H2>Application for Facility Support</H2>

All users of the Facility's data are strongly encouraged to submit an
Application for Facility Support (AFS). It is only by being able to report to
NERC on the projects it supports that the Facility is able to ensure
continued funding. <BR><BR> 

It is only obligatory to submit an AFS if you require:
<UL>
  <li><I>User Support</I>: you require any interaction with the Facility's
    Project Scientist e.g. for help with accessing, analysing, or
    interpreting the standard data products or for the provision of
    non-standard data products</li> 

  <li><I>Campaign Support</I>: you require the Facility to support an
    observation campaign</li>
    
  <LI><I>Guest Instrument Support</I>: you require the Facility to host a piece of
    guest equipment</li>

</UL>

Before submitting an AFS, you
should <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the Facility's Project
  Scientist</A> to check whether the desired support can be provided. <BR><BR>


Data users who have not applied for Facility Support should not expect
direct help with anything beyond the most trivial of
enquiries. They must rely solely on the online resources. They simply need to
