title: 'NERC MSTRF: access to the data'
---

<p>In keeping with NERC's open access data policy</A>:

<ul>
  <li>anyone may have free access to the NERC MST Radar Facility dataset</li>
  <li>use of the data is covered by
    the <a href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/">(UK) Open Government Licence</a></li> 
  <li>the data may be used for any purpose, including a commercial one</li>
  <li>the principal condition of use is that <a href="data_acknowledgement.html">the
    source of the data MUST be appropriately acknowledged</a></li>
</ul></p>

<p>In order to gain access to the data:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bd095d86e4a9f0c706b08058dbad3b31">Visit the NERC MSTRF dataset collection page in the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) catalogue</a></li>
  <li>Select the appropriate dataset from the dropdown menu</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>Request access</em> link if you don't already have
      access to the dataset and/or a CEDA account</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>Explore</em> link if you already have
      access to the dataset and a CEDA account</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>More Info</em> link if you would like more details
      about the dataset</li>  
</ul></p>

<p>Data files covering a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) day will
typically be made available during the morning following data
acquisition. This allows time for final quality control checks to be
carried out. The release of data will be delayed when the facility
manager is unavailable (e.g. during holidays and over weekends) or
  when there are technical problems with the data delivery.</p>

<H2>Application for Facility Support</H2>

<p>An application for facility support does not (necessarily) need to be
made if you simply want access to the data. However, one will be
necessary if you require:
<ul>
  <li><I>User Support</I>: you require any interaction with the Facility's
    Project Scientist e.g. for help with accessing, analysing, or
    interpreting the standard data products or for the provision of
    non-standard data products</li> 
  <li><I>Campaign Support</I>: you require the Facility to support an
    observation campaign</li>
  <LI><I>Guest Instrument Support</I>: you require the Facility to host a piece of
    guest equipment</li>
  </ul></p>

<p>Before submitting an application, you
should <a href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the Facility's Project
Scientist</a> to check whether the desired support is feasible. 
<a href="https://amof.ac.uk/apply/">Applications must be submitted through the
  Atmospheric Measurement & Observation Facility website</a>.</p>
