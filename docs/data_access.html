<h2>Acknowledgement of the data provider</h2> 

<p>There are two routes for accessing data from the NERC MST Radar
Facility. These are described below. In either case, you <b>must</b>
acknowledge the <a href="https://ncas.ac.uk/" target="_blank">National
Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS)</a> as the data provider
wherever the data are used. More details about NCAS's data policy can
be found on the <a href="https://amof.ac.uk/data/"
target="_blank">Atmospheric Measurement & Observation Facility (AMOF)
website</a>.</p>

<p>If you use the data within a publication, you should also cite the
dataset in the same way as you would cite a publication. The exact
format to use within the bibliography section of the publication is
given within the <b>Citable as</b> section of the relevant Centre for
Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) catalogue page. You can find a link
to this page through the <em>Datasets</em> section of the <a
href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bd095d86e4a9f0c706b08058dbad3b31"
target="_blank">NERC MST Radar Facility dataset collection CEDA catalogue
page</a>. The basic format is as follows:</p>

<dl> 
  <dd>Natural Environment Research Council
      Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere Radar Facility at
      Aberystwyth; Hooper, D.A. (<i>&lt;year-of-dataset-creation&gt;</i>):
      <i>&lt;name-of-dataset&gt;</i>. Centre for Environmental Data
      Analysis,
      <i>&lt;date-of-citation&gt;</i>. <i>&lt;catalogue-page-url&gt;</i></dd>
</dl>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>&lt;year-of-dataset-creation&gt;</i> is the year that the dataset
      was first created.</li>
  <li><i>&lt;name-of-dataset&gt;</i> is the official CEDA name for the
      dataset.</li>
  <li><i>&lt;date-of-citation&gt;</i> is the date (in YYYY-MM-DD format)
      when the data were accessed. If data were accessed at different
      time, the date of the last access should be used.</li>
  <li><i>&lt;catalogue-page-url&gt;</i> is the web address of the CEDA
      catalogue page for the dataset.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Campaign support</h2>

<p>You will need to submit an application through the <a
href="https://amof.ac.uk/apply/">Atmospheric Measurement & Observation
Facility website</a> if you require:

<ul>
  <li>the MST Radar to be operated in support of a campaign</li>
  <li>guest instruments to be hosted at the radar site</li>
</ul>

You should discuss your requirements with the <a
href="contacting_facility_staff.html">Facility Manager</a> before
submitting an application to ensure that they are feasible.

<h2>Long term measurement programme data</h2>

<p>Data from:
<ul>
  <li>the MST Radar when it is not being operated in support of a campaign</li>
  <li><a href="instruments.html">the other instruments operated by the
      NERC MST Radar Facility</a></li>
</ul>

contribute to NCAS's long term measurement programme. You do not need
to submit an application through the AMOF website in order to access
them. The data:</p>

<ul>
  <li>are made openly-accessible under the <a
      href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/"
      target="_blank">(UK) Open Government Licence</a></li>
  <li>may be used for any purpose, including a commercial one</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to gain access to the data:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/bd095d86e4a9f0c706b08058dbad3b31" 
         target="_blank">Visit the NERC MSTRF dataset collection page in the Centre
         for Environmental Data Analysis (CEDA) catalogue</a></li>
  <li>Select the appropriate dataset from the dropdown <i>Datasets</i> menu</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>Request access</em> link if you don't already have
      access to the dataset and/or a CEDA account</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>Explore</em> link if you already have
      access to the dataset and a CEDA account</li>
  <li>Follow the <em>More Info</em> link if you would like more details
      about the dataset</li>  
</u>

<p>Data files covering a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) day will
typically be made available during the morning following data
acquisition. This allows time for final quality control checks to be
carried out. The release of data will be delayed when the facility
manager is unavailable (e.g. during holidays and over weekends) or
  when there are technical problems with the data delivery.</p>
