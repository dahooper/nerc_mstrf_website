The Facility has been operating a Vaisala LD40 laser ceilometer (the
upright white instrument to the left in the above image) at the radar
site since 8th August 2005. Backscatter data have been recorded in
addition to the standard cloud base data since 24th April
2007. However, the former will not be made available through the BADC until
they have been rewritten into self-documented netCDF files (the cloud
base data are already available in NASA-Ames format files). Please <A
href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the NERC MST Radar Facility Project
Scientist</A> if you have an immediate need for the backscatter data. An <A
href="#example">example</A> plot is shown at the bottom of
this page. <BR><BR>

The LD40 operates according to the Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)
principle, which is similar to that of radar. It transmits short
pulses of laser light which are scattered back to the instrument from
atmospheric targets. The distance of the targets from the instrument
is determined by the time delay between the transmission and reception
of a pulse. The instrument is vertically-pointing and so the distance
gives a measure of the altitude of the targets above mean sea
level. The main targets are aerosols (e.g. small soot or dust
particles), water droplets, snow flakes and ice crystals. Aerosol
concentrations tend to be high within the boundary layer leading to
laser returns from a continuum of low-level altitudes. Aerosol
concentrations tend to be much lower within the over-lying free
atmosphere and so significant laser returns are only subsequently
detected from cloud layers. The vertical profile of the receiver
signal amplitude may consequently be used to determine cloud base
altitudes. If a cloud layer is sufficiently optically thin that it
does not not fully attenuate the transmitted pulses, subsequent cloud
layers may be detected.<BR><BR>

The LD40 transmits 75 ns duration pulses at a repetition frequency of
6494 Hz. The temperature of the laser diode is maintained within a
narrow range in order to ensure high stability of the emitted
wavelength. This allows a very narrow band optical filter to be used
at the input to the receiver. The receiver signal amplitude is sampled
at time intervals of 50 ns, corresponding to altitude intervals of 7.5
m. Owing to the low power of the transmitter, the receiver signal
amplitude for a single pulse backscattered from a high-altitude cloud
is not sufficiently large to be distinguished above the noise
level. Nevertheless the contribution from cloud backscatter remains
coherent from pulse to pulse, whereas that from noise varies
randomly. Consequently the detectability of the desired signal can be
greatly improved by summing the receiver signal amplitude (separately
for each altitude interval) over all pulses within a 15 s
interval. Attention is restricted to altitudes below 13.05 km
(corresponding to maximum range of detection of 13.00 km - the
instrument is at 50 m above mean sea level) since, even after
summation, the presence of any clouds which might exist at higher
altitudes can only be determined with difficulty.<BR><BR>

The instrument manufacturer's cloud detection algorithm is applied to
the 15 s receiver signal amplitude profiles. It is designed to detect
up to three possible cloud layers. For each of these, the altitude
(above mean sea level) of the cloud base and the depth to which the
laser light penetrates is determined. If the laser light is not able
to penetrate the entire depth of a particular cloud layer, missing
datum values are given for subsequent layers. If no cloud layer is
detected, missing datum values are given for all three layers. In
order to distinguish between cloud-free conditions and a lack of
observations, attention should be paid to instrument status flag. An
estimate is also given of the maximum possible altitude of cloud
detection and of the visibility for a human observer looking
upwards. The maximum range of cloud detection defaults to 13.05 km
under clear sky conditions. A lower value implies that no information
may be given on any cloud layers which may exist beyond this
altitude. Under such conditions there is also a limit to the
visibility for a human observer. Otherwise a missing datum value is
given. Finally, an estimate is given of the precipitation rate based
on the characteristics of the backscatter profile. A value of 0
implies no precipitation and a value of 3 suggests heavy
precipitation.  <BR><BR>

The instrument sends a data message to a logging computer every 15
s. Date-time stamps are provided by the instrument's internal clock
rather than by the computer's. They contain fields for hours and
minutes but not for seconds. Only one of the 4 messages for each
minute is saved. The instrument's internal clock can only be
synchronised manually. Since this requires a special connection to be
made via the serial service interface, it is only done on an
infrequent basis. The accuracy of the internal clock's time decreases
with increasing time.<BR><BR>

The backscatter coefficient represents the (scaled) natural logarithm
of the range-squared-corrected receiver signal power. The speckling
above 2 km altitude represents noise, which appears to vary diurnally. <BR><BR>
