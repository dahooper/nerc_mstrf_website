title: The radion refractive index structure of the atmosphere

The refractive index of the atmosphere, n, at radio frequencies
between HF and UHF is given by:<BR><BR>

<DL>where:
  <DD>e - partial pressure of water vapour (hPa)
  <DD>T - absolute temperature (K)
  <DD>p - atmospheric pressure (hPa)
  <DD>N<SUB>e</SUB> - number density of free electrons (m<SUP>-3</SUP>)
  <DD>f - radio frequency (MHz)
</DL>

<P>Since the magnitudes of the deviations from 1.0 are very small, it
is useful to define the refractivity, N, where:</P>

<P>The first term, in the top equation, represents the 'humidity'
contribution. Water molecules have a dipole moment which varies with
the frequency of the incident electromagnetic radiation. At visible
light frequencies only the polarised electric field of the water
molecules contributes. For the range HF to UHF, however, the water
molecules can additionally reorient themselves rapidly enough to
follow the changes of the incident electric field. The second term
represents the 'density' contribution. The third term only begins to
become signficant at altitudes above 50 km. The figure below shows the
relative contributions of the humidity and density terms to the
refractivity based on the U.S. Standard Atmosphere 1976 (temperature
profile shown in the left panel) for altitudes up to 20 km.</P>

<P>The profile of partial pressure of water vapour is assumed to
follow the saturation vapour pressure, e<SUB>s</SUB>, for the given
temperature profile, i.e. for 100% relative humidity at all altitudes,
where:</P>

<P>Despite the fact that the (maximum possible) humidity contribution
is smaller than the density contribution at all altitudes, the radar
return signal power for clear air returns is related to the vertical
gradient of the refractive index; the humidity contribution can
dominate for altitudes up to the (almost) the tropopause level.</P>
