The NERC MST (Mesosphere-Stratosphere-Troposphere) Radar is a 46.5
MHz pulsed Doppler radar located at Capel Dewi, near Aberystwyth in
west Wales. It is the UK's most powerful and versatile wind-profiling
instrument. <FONT color="#ff0000">It is operated predominantly in the
ST mode, covering the altitude range 2 - 20 km, for which MST radars
are unique in their ability to give continuous measurements of the
three-dimensional wind vector at high resolution</FONT> - typically 300
m in altitude and 2 - 3 minutes in time. Moreover, under certain
circumstances, it can provide information about atmospheric stability,
turbulence and precipitation. It is therefore ideally suited for
studying everything from large scale weather systems down to
small-scale atmospheric phenomena.<BR><BR>

The radar began operations in 1990 and has been operated on a
quasi-continuous basis since 1997.
