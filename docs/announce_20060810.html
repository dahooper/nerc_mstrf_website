<B>A new instrument operations/performance weblog</B><BR> 

Details of problems encountered with data collection and of changes to
observation schedules, for instruments at the NERC MST Radar site, are
now available through a new weblog:<BR><BR>

<CENTER><A href="cgi-bin/mstlog_public/mst_event_search.py">http://mst.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/mstlog_public/mst_event_search.py</A></CENTER><BR>

Eventually this will be back-populated with details recorded for the
MST Radar Facility Experimenters' meetings. However, for the time
being attention will be focussed on entering the latest
information.<BR><BR>

Details can be retrieved by searching the log within given date-time
limits or by character strings. Note that the latter is case sensitive
and so the search term "MST Radar" will give different results to the
search term "MST radar". <BR><BR>
