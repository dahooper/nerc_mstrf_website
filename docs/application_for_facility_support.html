<p><b>WARNING:</b> This page is out of date. <a href="data_access.html">Visit the
	data access page for updated details</a>.</p>

<p>This page provides guidance on how to complete an Application for Facility
Support (AFS) - not on <A href="data_access.html">how to gain access to the
    data</A>, which is a separate issue.</p>

<p><A href="data_access.html">Click here for details of the purpose of the
  AFS and of who needs to submit one</A>.</p>

Please do not hesitate to <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the
      Facility's Project Scientist</A> if:
<ul>
  <li>you are unsure as to whether you need to submit an AFS</li>
  <li>you require the AFS form in a format other than MS-Word</li>
  <li>you require any guidance on completing the form</li>
</ul>

<p>You are advised to discuss your requirements
with <A href="contacting_facility_staff.html">the Facility's Project
    Scientist</A> before you submit an AFS. This will ensure that the Facility
is able to provide the type of support that you are seeking.</P>



<H2>The Scope of Facility Support</H2>

<p>The provision of Facility Support is equivalent to the allocation of NERC
resources. Consequently, Applications for Facility Support (AFS) will be
graded according to their scientific merits by members of the NERC Atmospheric
Radar Facilities Steering Committee (NARFSC). These grades will be used
(amongst other ways) to establish which projects should be prioritised, in case
demand for support exceeds the Facility's ability to provide it. </p>

<p>Data users who fall outside of NERC's scope - e.g. those who are not in
possession of a NERC grant, those from outside of the UK, and students below
PhD level - are welcome to apply for Facility Support. Although your projects
will (typically) be given a lower priority than NERC projects, we will support
them when possible. </p>

<p>Users who have been granted Facility Support are expected to provide a short
update (i.e. one paragraph of text) on their projects on a yearly
basis. The Facility's Project Scientist will contact you during the early part
of the calendar year to request this. The details will only be made available to
members of the NARFSC. You will also be expected to provide details of any
publications which have been supported by the
Facility. <A href="publications.html">The publication details will be made
	      publicly available through the Facility's website.</A></p>

<DL>
<DT><H2>GENERAL DETAILS</H2>
<DD>
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Title of the project for which Facility Support is being requested</B> -
  free text
  <DD>This should be concise and descriptive.<BR><BR>

  <A name="project_type"></A> 
  <DT><B>Type of Facility Support required</B> - select each that applies
  <DD>The options are <I>User Support</I>, <I>Campaign
      Support</I>, and <I>Instrument Support</I>. In the case of the
    latter two, make sure you discuss your requirements with the Facility's
    Project Scientist before submitting an AFS. If you are not obliged to
    submit an AFS, but are doing so as a courtesy, please select <I>User
      Support</I> irrespective of whether or not you think you need it. <BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Date of submitting this application</B> - in day/month/year format<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Expected end date of the project</B> - in month/year format
  <DD>In the case of a student project, this will typically be the expected end
    date of the period of study/research. In the case of a project funded by a
    grant, the end date of the grant will typically be used. This information
    is used by Facility staff for guidance only. Support will typically
    continue for as long as is necessary.

<A name="applicant"></A> 
<DT><H2>DETAILS OF THE DATA USER ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROJECT</H2>
<DD>If more than one person is likely to use the Facility's data in association
  with this project, please add
  (i.e. cut and paste) a table for each additional person.
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Title and full name</B> - free text
  <DD>Where the applicant has an academic title, e.g Dr or Prof, this should
  be given. Otherwise a title such as Mr, Miss, Ms or Mrs may be given. The
  applicant's full name - including middle names or initials - should be
  given. <BR><BR> 

  <DT><B>Status</B> - free text
  <DD>In the case of a student, both the degree being studied for (e.g. BSc,
    MSc or PhD) and the subject area (e.g. atmospheric physics) should be
    given. Other examples of "status" include "post-doctoral researcher",
    "research fellow", "lecturer", "reader", and "professor".<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>E-mail address</B> - free text<BR><BR> 

  <DT><B>Telephone number</B> - free text
  <DD>It is not mandatory to include this information and it is unlikely to be
    relevant in the case of students below PhD level. <BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Name and address of place of work or study</B> - free text
  <DD>In the case of an applicant based at a University, or at an equivalent
    institution, the name of the
  Department should be included in the address. In the case of a
  non-UK-based applicant, the name of the country should be included. <BR><BR> 
  </DL>

<DT><H2>DETAILS OF THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE PROJECT</H2>
<DD>Each project requires a Principal Investigator (PI), who must be eligible
  for (but not necessarily in possession of) a NERC grant. This is someone who
  is permanently employed at a UK-based research organisation (e.g. a Higher
  Education Institution or a Research Council) at lecturer level, at an
  equivalent level, or above. Post-doctoral researchers on fixed-term contracts
  are not eligible. <BR><BR>

  <B>In all cases</B>, since NERC resources are effectively being allocated to
  the PI, it is important that the nominated person is aware that they are
  being used in this role.<BR><BR>

  <B>In the case of a student project</B>, the PI will typically
  be the supervisor.<BR><BR> 

  <B>In the case of project for which there is no eligible PI</B>, the
  Facility's Project Scientist will act as your PI in the context of reporting
  to NERC. If this is the case, please make it clear on the AFS. <BR><BR>
  </DL>

<DT><H2>DETAILS OF FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT</H2>
<DD>
  <DL>
  <DT><B>Source of funding for the project</B> - free text
  <DD>Abbreviations can be used in the case of British Research Councils -
  e.g. NERC, STFC, EPSRC. Otherwise the name of the source of funding should
  be given in full. If there is no specific source of funding, "none" or
    "internal" may be given as a response. <BR><BR>

  <DT>The following fields only need to be completed if NERC is the source of
  funding for the project. <BR><BR>
  
  <DT><B>Funding mode</B> - select one
  <DD>Options are <I>Directed</I>, <I>Blue Skies</I>, <I>Core Strategic</I>,
  <I>Commercial/Repayment</I>, and <I>Infrastructure</I>. This information is
  given on a NERC grant. If the person requiring data access is centrally
  funded, e.g. through NCAS, the <I>Core Strategic</I> option should be
  selected.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Funding type</B> - select one
  <DD>Options are <I>Studentship</I>, <I>Research Grant</I>,
  and <I>Other</I>. This information is given on a NERC grant. If the person
  requiring data access is centrally funded, e.g. through NCAS,
  the <I>Other</I> option should be selected.<BR><BR>

  <DT><B>Grant number</B> - free text<BR><BR>
  </DL>

<DT><H2>NERC SCIENCE AREAS ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT</H2> - mark each one that
  applies.<BR><BR>

  <DD>At least one of the first four options - <I>Atmospheric</I>, <I>Earth</I>,
  <I>Marine</I>, <I>Terrestrial & Freshwater</I> - must be
  selected. Virtually all
  projects which have made use of data from the NERC MST Radar Facility have
  fallen under the <I>Atmospheric</I> area. Consequently this is the option
  which should be selected if the project does not obviously fit into any of
  the other areas. More than one of these first four areas may be selected if
  appropriate. For example, projects within NERC's Flood Risk from Extreme
  Events (FREE) programme may additionally/instead fall under
  the <I>Terrestrial & Freshwater</I> area.<BR><BR>

  If any of the final three areas - <I>Earth Observation</I>,
  <I>Science-Based Archaeology</I> and <I>Polar</I> - is appropriate, it
  should be selected in addition. It is not obligatory to select any. More than
  one of these may be selected if  appropriate. In practice, only the <I>Earth
    Observation</I> area is ever  likely to be appropriate - for projects which
  are fundamentally associated  with satellite observations (in addition to
  data from the NERC MST Radar Facility).<BR><BR>

 
  <A href="http://www.nerc.ac.uk/research/areas/">More details about the scope
    of the science areas can be found on the NERC website</A>.<BR><BR><BR>
  </DT>
  
<DT><H2>NERC SCIENCE PRIORITY AREAS ADDRESSED BY THE PROJECT</H2> - mark each
  one that applies.<BR><BR>

  <DD>At least one area must be selected even if none looks immediately
 appropriate. Examples are given below of the sorts of actual research areas
 which may be fitted into some of the different science priority areas. More
 than one science priority area may be selected if appropriate.<BR><BR>

  <B>Climate System:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents or
  phenomena which can affect the climate, e.g. aerosols, clouds, water
  vapour, ozone, stratosphere-troposphere exchange, atmospheric tides,
  atmospheric (gravity) waves<BR><BR>

  <B>Biodiversity:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents or
  phenomena which affect life forms, e.g. the effects of winds on
  bird/bat/insect feeding/migration patterns<BR><BR>

  <B>Sustainable Use Of Natural Resources:</B> projects concerned
  with energy generation or energy use, e.g. wind-energy, aircraft flying
  procedures<BR><BR>

  <B>Earth System Science:</B> projects which look at the Earth system as
  a whole, e.g. the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean<BR><BR>

  <B>Natural Hazards:</B> projects focusing on any atmospheric constituents
  or phenomena which can be hazardous, e.g. volcanic dust, extreme wind
  events, rainfall, snow, flooding<BR><BR>

  <B>Environment, Pollution and Human Health:</B> projects focusing on any
  atmospheric constituents or phenomena which can affect human health,
  e.g. the dispersion of airborne pollutants by wind<BR><BR>

  <B>Technologies:</B> projects focusing on new instruments and analysis
  techniques, e.g. novel ways of processing or interpreting MST radar
  data<BR><BR><BR>

<DT><H2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION</H2> - free text<BR><BR>

   <DD> This should be approximately 1 page in length and should address the
   objectives of the project, its scientific relevance, and the proposed
   approach. Please remember that the AFS will be graded by members of the
   NARFSC and that the grades will be used to establish priorities for
   support. The project description does not have to be as polished or as
   detailed as it would need to be for a grant application, but it does need to
   be clear. Members of the NARFSC are specialists in various aspects of
   atmospheric science. Please explain any specialist terms or concepts which
   fall outside of this field. If the project requires <I>Instrument
	Support</I> or <I>Campaign Support</I> appropriate details should be
   included.  

</DL><BR><BR>

The completed AFS should be mailed back to the Facility's Project
Scientist.
