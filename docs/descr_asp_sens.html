<P>The term aspect sensitivity is typically used to describe the
decrease of radar return signal power often seen (particularly at
stratospheric altitudes) with increasing beam pointing zenith angle;
there can also be a smaller variation of radar return signal power as
a function of beam azimuth angle. In connection with the plots shown
here the term is used to imply the ratio of radar return signal powers
between the vertical and 6&deg; off-vertical beam observations. It
relates to the mechanism responsible for the radar returns which, in
turn, relates to the horizontal homogeneity/inhomogeneity of the
refractive index irregularities which, in turn, relates to whether or
not the atmosphere has been recently mixed by turbulence. The aspect
sensitivity is typically, but not always, high in the stratosphere and
low in the troposphere. However, it is particularly interesting where
it shows the opposite behaviour. Certainly some laminae of low aspect
sensitivity in the lower stratosphere can be clearly associated with
active turbulent mixing, though it remains to be established how long
such a condition persists after the mixing has ceased. Moreover, at
best the aspect sensitivity can be used to identify the
<I>presence</I> of turbulence. In principle a quantitative measure can
be derived from the spectral width, though in practice this also has
its limitations.</P><BR>
