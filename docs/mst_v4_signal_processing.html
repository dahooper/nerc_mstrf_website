title: 'NERC MSTRF: Version 4 signal processing for MST radar'
---

<p>An improved - version 4 (v4) - MST Radar data processing scheme was 
introduced in early 2017. Compared with data from the
older <a href="file_format_v3_cartesian.html">v3 Cartesian files</a>,
data from the new <a href="file_format_mst_cardinal_v4-0.html">v4 Cardinal
    files</a> have the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the horizontal wind components have a significant lower random
    measurement error
  <li>the horizontal wind components have a slightly better time-altitude
    coverage 
  <li>the beam-broadening-corrected (vertical beam) spectral widths have a
    slightly better time-altitude coverage
</ul>

<p>Further details of these improvements are given below.</p>

<p>Users of MST Radar data are encouraged to switch to the v4 Cardinal data
  files. Please <a href="contacting_facility_staff.html">contact the 
    NERC MST Radar Facility</a> if v4 files are not available for the
  dates that you are interested in.</p> 
</p>

<p>The v4 data processing scheme currently uses v3 Cartesian data as
  input. It is consequently possible to generate v4.0 files for (almost) any
  date for which v3 files already exist. The v4 scheme will
  eventually be extended so that it can process data from the spectral level
  upwards. </p>


<h2>Random Measurement Errors</h2>
<p>The v3 data processing scheme - described
by <a href="publications_by_year.html#2008">Hooper et al. (2008)</a> - was
designed to produce the best possible estimates of winds based on
measurements made during a single cycle of observation (which typically lasts
for just over 5 minutes). As can be seen from the figure below, the
  representativeness of these estimates can be improved by smoothing the data
  in time. A statistical analysis has shown that the optimal level of smoothing
  is approximately 6 cycles (31.4 minutes) for tropospheric altitudes (further
  smoothing can reduce the random error slightly for stratospheric
  altitudes). Consequently the v4 Cardinal files contain wind components that
  have been smoothed over a nominal interval of 33 minutes (which allows for
  small variations in cycle duration). </p>

<h2>Improved time-altitude coverage</h2>
<p>A side effect of smoothing the wind data in time is that it fills in short
  data gaps. This also applies to the beam-broadening corrected (vertical
  beam) spectral widths, since they rely on the wind speed as well as on the raw
  vertical beam spectral widths. However, the numerical difference between
  using smoothed (v4) or unsmoothed (v3) wind speeds to correct the spectral
  widths is only apparent where the raw spectral width is marginally greater
  than the beam broadening contribution. Where the raw spectral width is
  significantly greater, the difference is negligible.</p> 

<h2>Compensation for the effects of aspect sensitivity</h2>
<p>The term aspect sensitivity refers to the decrease in radar return
  signal power that is often seen with increasing beam pointing zenith
  angle. This causes an off-vertical beam to be weighted more heavily on its
  lower zenith angle side than on its higher zenith angle side. The beam's
  effective zenith angle will consequently be slightly smaller than the nominal
  value and the magnitude of the horizontal wind component will be
  correspondingly underestimated. A compensation factor for this effect can be
  derived from the ratio of the signal powers observed at two zenith
  angles. This factor has already been applied to the wind components in
  the v3 and v4 data files and its values are included simply for reference
  purposes.</p>

<p>The v3 processing scheme uses signal powers at zenith angles of 4.2&deg;
  (from a single beam - orange line in figure above) and 6.0&deg; (from the
  mean of four beams in orthogonal azimuths - blue line). Owing to the small
  difference between these angles, the compensation factor (orange line) is
  highly sensitive to small variations in the signal power ratio. Moreover, the
  use of only a single beam pointing direction at 4.2&deg; off-vertical
  neglects any variations in signal power as a function of azimuth. Values
  based on the mean signal power from four beams at 4.2&deg; off-vertical in
  orthogonal azimuths are shown (green line) for reference. This figure
  uses data from a special campaign period when observations were made in
  all <a href="nerc_mstr_beam_dirs.html">17 available beam pointing
    directions</a>. The 3 additional beam pointing directions at 4.2&deg;
  off-vertical are not available during standard observations. The v4
  processing scheme reduces the significance of these limitations by using the
  ratio of signal powers observed at zenith angles of 0.0&deg; (red line) and
  6.0&deg;. Users should therefore expect slight differences between the
  horizontal wind speeds derived from time-smoothed v3 data and v4 data. </p>
