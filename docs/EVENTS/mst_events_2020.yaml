  text: 'Instrument: MST Radar. The radar experienced a raised noise floor between
    13:45 and 14:15 UTC, which is more apparent in the m-mode data than the st-mode
    data. This was during a period of deep convection and intense rainfall, with 10
    minute mean rates of around 30 mm/hour. The wind data are already flagged as being
    unreliable, which might be the result of the rapid vertical velocity variations
    caused by the convection.'
