  text: 'Instrument: Broadband modem. There was no internet connection to the site
    during most of this period. DAH first spotted the break just a few hours into
    the period and remotely power-cycled the modem at   2013-12-28 09:50. Although
    the quick-look plots appear to have been updating for the next 3 days, the spectral
    files were not being transferred up to RAL. The quick-look plots stopped updating
    at 2013-12-31  18:41. DAH did not spot the problem until 11:08 the following day.
    However, it took him 3 attempts at remotely power-cycling the modem before he
    could re-establish a connection. Connectivity did not last for long and despite
    numerous attempts that day and the next, he only re-established it briefly on
    a few occasions. The ISP was closed on New Year''s Day and so DAH had to wait
    until 2014-01-02 before speaking to them. LD came to the site that morning and
    established that the "fax" line (used for the broadband connection) was very noisy.
    He switched the modem to the Manchester University "phone" line for a while (this
    was primarily to allow the backlog of Met Office messages to upload). However,
    under instructions from the ISP he reconnected the modem to the "fax" line in
    case Open Reach began line testing the following morning. The ISP changed their
    advice the following day (Friday 2014-01-03) since it had now been established
    that the problem was classified as a phone line fault and not a broadband one.
    Apparently an Open Reach engineer attempted to visit the site at around 10:00
    on Sunday 2014-01-05, but obviously found no-one there. They are now scheduled
    to return on the afternoon of 2014-01-09. The University of Manchester line continues
    to be used in the meantime.'

  text: 'Instrument: MST Radar. Data are unavailable for this period since some of
    the spectral files were causing the signal processing software to crash. LD spotted
    from the quick-look plots that something was wrong at around 16:00 and was on
    site at around 17:00. He was surprised to find that the radar was apparently working
    and called DAH, who had not yet spotted the gap in data. DAH quickly established
    the immediate (rather than the underlying) cause of the problem and removed the
    spectral files for the period 14:15 - 15:21. He subsequently established that
    the gap between dwells (which is normally around 25 s) suddenly increased to over
    7 minutes after the 3rd dwell of the cycle. There was a gap of over 20 minutes
    after the 5th dwell. There is no indication as to what might have caused this
    problem. The logs seem to rule out a communications failure with the beam steering
    unit. They do, however, show that the forward power was low for antenna sectors
    B and E 14:20 - 14:23 UT, and for sectors A, B, and C 14:28 - 14:53 UT. '

    problem, which began to manifest itself at 14:15. The same PC, "julius", is used
    for controlling the radar and acquiring WXT510 data. Owing to internet problems,
    which began around the same time, DAH did not spot this problem until 2014-01-06.
    He solved it by killing of the existing process and restarting it.'
