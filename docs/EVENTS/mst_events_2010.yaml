  text: "Instrument: Vaisala LD40 Laser Ceilometer. The instrument ceased to make\
    \ observations. The error code changed from \"00000000\" to \"00050004\", which\
    \ (according to the Vasiala handbook) suggests: \"Test laser failure. Error. No\
    \ more measurements possible.\" The problem cleared by itself just over 24 hours\
    \ later.  \n\nThe advice given by the Vasiala helpdesk is as follows:  According\
    \ to the manual (M210256, revision D), the error descrpition reads for the fault\
    \ 00050004 (error code 52):\n\n\"Check test laser: The test laser must be regulated\
    \ to a constant output signal: Utlpm = 3.25 V. If the test laser output cannot\
    \ be adjusted to the correct value by the software but the value is still within\
    \ valid tolerance limits, the lower luminous intensity is compensated by way of\
    \ calculation. If the software cannot adjust the test laser within the valid tolerance\
    \ limits, a failure message is generated.\"\n\nThe solution to the error code,\
    \ however, states:\n\n\"Replace the receiver module and/or the Main Board PCB\
    \ 1540 and/or the test laser.\nRefer to section Receiver Module Replacement on\
    \ page 110.\"\n\nSo there might be fault in the receiver or Main board instead\
    \ of the test laser, or in the worst case scenario, fault at multiple modules.\
    \ \n\nIf you have spare parts on location, you could try changing one or another\
    \ of the mentioned modules to see if the error goes away. Changing the receiver\
    \ module is described in the manual. Changing the test laser is not but it's easy\
    \ since the part is connected only with two screws and a coax cable. \nChanging\
    \ the mother board should be the last choice due its complexity and lack of instructions\
    \ in the manual (it's prefarbly done at our service center)."

  text: Instrument WXT510. The piezo-electric sensor failed to detect any precipitation
    during this day, although the tipping bucket rain gauge did. Although there has
    been some doubt recently as to whether the sensor is capable of detecting light
    rain, the tipping bucket rain gauge data show 10 minute mean rates peaking at
    over 10 mm/hour in two events of heavy rain - 10:00 - 13:30 UT and 14:50 - 20:10.
    These should definitely have been detected by the WXT510. The cause of the problem
    is unknown.
