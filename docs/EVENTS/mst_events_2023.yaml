  text: 'Instrument: Campbell Scientific surface met. The timing of the precipitation
    detected by the tipping bucket rain gauge should be treated with caution. Although
    the LD40 and WXT520 indicated a precipitation event just before 03:00 UTC and another
    one around 04:30 UTC, which should have given a sufficient accumulation to be 
    detected by the tipping bucket, its first tip occured at 05:30 UTC when the other
    two instruments suggest that there was no precipitation. Similarly, the timing of
    the succession of tips between 10:00 and 16:50 UTC do not correspond well with 
    timing of precipitation detected by the other two instruments. Temperatures had
    been around 0 degrees C during the morning and so it is possible that the inlet
    for the rain gauge was partially blocked.'
