    detected by the tipping bucket, its first tip occured at 05:30 UTC when the other
    two instruments suggest that there was no precipitation. Similarly, the timing of
    the succession of tips between 10:00 and 16:50 UTC do not correspond well with 
    timing of precipitation detected by the other two instruments. Temperatures had
