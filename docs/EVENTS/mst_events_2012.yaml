    problems with the transmitter which powers antenna sector A. LD swapped the cables
    connecting the transmitter to the phase lock unit with those for another transmitter.
    At first it was thought that this lead to just a slight reduction in received
    signal power. However, the "Secondary Radial Chain Exists" diagnostic data indicate
    that this introduced unwanted signals into the spectra. The problem stopped only
    when the transmitter went down, which lead to a raising of the noise floor.  '
