    damage to buildings. Although there is evidence (in the MST radar data) of convection
    around this time, there is nothing obvious to suggest that it is out of the ordinary.
    Frongoch surface wind data do show an increase in speed from around 6 m/s to 10
    m/s around this time, but the higher speeds persist for at least an hour. The
    event appears to have been coincident with a surface cold front as the wind direction
    (in meteorological convention) changes from around 170 degrees to around 240 degrees
    at this time. '
