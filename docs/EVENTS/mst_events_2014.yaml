  text: 'Instrument: Campbell Scientific Wind Sensors. There were several instances
    during this period when the raw data readings, including for wind direction, were
    all zeros. These do not look realistic. Although at first it was assumed that
    there had been a malfunction of the data logger, these are possibly artefacts
    of very low wind speeds, e.g. of the wind speed dropping so low that it cannot
    overcome the friction of the wind vane''s bearings. Although this does not (obviously)
    explain why the direction readings should also be zero, all cases were associated
