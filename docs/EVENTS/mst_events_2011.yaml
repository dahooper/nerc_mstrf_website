  text: 'Instrument: MST Radar. For some reason, communications between the radar
    control PC and the beam steering control PC became broken, which stopped from
    the beam direction changing from the Vertical. This resulted in the horizontal
    wind speed appearing (incorrectly) to be close to 0.0 m/s. DAH spotted this as
    soon as he reached the office and blocked the feed of data to the Met Office and
    interrupted the observation cycle shortly after 07 UT. He was able to localise
    the problem by examining the logs for both units. The beam steering controller
    PC was rebooted for good measure and LD changed phasing unit 77, which was flagged
    up as being faulty. However, the error message persisted with the replacement
    unit until LD investigated the wiring to the unit. This cleared the problem without
    LD having discovered any obvious problem, suggested that a sub-optimal connection
    was to blame. Incidentally, ATRAD happened to be monitoring the beam steering
    controller unit at the time and sent an alert by e-mail.     '
