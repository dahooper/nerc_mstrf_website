    and horizontal wind-components are derived using the vertical dwell which is closest

    restarted manually) when the power was resumed at around 14:20 UT. PC Augustus

    A reading of 354.6 degrees was as close as could be managed. At first it was suspected

  text: "Instrument: MST Radar. The radar initially suffered from unusual symptoms,\
    \ which were similar to those seen 2007-05-17 - 2007-05-18. This primarily consisted\
    \ of a series of interference bands, with (apparently) equal Doppler velocity\
    \ spacing, affecting the lowest several range gates. A consequence of this was\
    \ that vertical wind data were only available in the middle range gates and the\
    \ horizontal winds were filtered out at all range gates by the quality control\
    \ procedures. LD was able to visit the site on the afternoon of 2009-12-18 (a\
    \ Friday), although he and DAH were unable to diagnose the cause of the problem.\
    \ Consequently the radar was stopped at 15:30 UT and left idle over the weekend.\n\
    \nLD was able to be on site again on the morning of 2009-12-21 (the Monday). He\
    \ and DAH followed the procedure used when a similar problem had been seen on\
    \ 2007-05-17, when a phase-lock issue was suspected. All TXs were taken out of\
    \ line and then, starting with TX4, made active whilst the spectra were inspected.\
    \ Three TXs were up by about 12:00 on 2009-12-21. However, it was not until 16:00,\
    \ that TX6, which had blown its choke earlier in the day, was activiated and the\
    \ data feed was resumed. \n\nSpectra acquired for test purposes during the earlier\
    \ part of 2009-12-21 were discarded.   "
