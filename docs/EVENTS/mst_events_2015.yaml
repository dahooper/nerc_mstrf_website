    to a loss of mains electricity, which lasted for over 3 hours. The radar control
    PC appears to have shut down at around 05:50 UT, after its UPS unit became fully
    discharged. After the power and internet connection were resumed (shortly after
    09 UT), DAH deleted the spectral files for the final, incomplete cycle, which
    began at 05:47:47 UT. This was in case they crashed the signal processing software.
    He was able to remotely restart the radar at 12:40 UT, although the beam steering
    unit does not appear to have been changing the beam pointing direction (DAH had
    blocked the transfer of data to the Met Office during the restart period). It
    gave a warning message, "Refusing connection. Beam command socket already connected".
    Consequently DAH stopped the radar at 13:15 UT before rebooting the beam steering
    PC, which does not appear to have shut down during the electricity outage. The
    beam steering unit appeared to operate as expected when DAH restarted the radar
    at 13:45 UT. However, he did not remove the block from the Met Office''s data
    feed until around 15:30 UT, when he was confident that everything was back to
    normal.'
