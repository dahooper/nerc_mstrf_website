    This was not immediately apparent as a problem since variations in altitude coverage
    are commonly associated with changes in atmospheric structure. However, the altitude
    coverage was reduced to a very low level on 2007-04-06. Since this was Good Friday,
    the problem was not spotted by DAH until the following Tuesday, 2007-04-10 (Monday
    having also been a Bank Holiday), by which time the problem was less sever. The
    source of the problem was not immediately apparent. The radar return spectra suggested
    that reliable profiles (with good radial continuity) should be obtainable over
    a much greater altitude range. This prompted DAH to check the status of the dynamic
    signal processing. It turns out that dwells were not being archived once they
    had been finished with. The backlog stretched back to 2007/04/03 06 UT. This could
    have caused the time-continuity checks for the most recent data to have been performed
    against an inappropriate (out of date) reference. The prevalence of high pressure
    conditions over the past several days meant that the wind conditions had not changed
    sufficiently for the time continuity tests to have failed completely. DAH cleared

    DAH was updating the Axis firmware from version 4.30 to 4.40. Unexpectedly this

  text: 'Instrument: Surface wind sensors. The clock on the data logging PC was found
    to have been running slow. Although the PC had been set up to synchronise its
    clock using Network Time Protocol, this had not been happening and so the clock
    was approximately 7 minutes behind actual time (its clock showed 09:46 when it
    was resynchronised at 09:53 UT on 2007-10-03). This will have affected both the
    surface met and surface wind data loggers, which synchronise their clocks to that
    of the PC. Note that the surface met sensor data logger was only re-installed,
    after being sent away for repairs, on 2007-10-03.'

  text: 'Instrument: MST Radar. The radar developed an instability overnight, which
    was apparent in the scope trace on either the I or the Q channel output of the
    receiver. It''s not clear which - but only one channel was affected. This was
    causing contamination of the wind profile data. DAH blocked data being sent to
    the Met Office at around 08 UT, but the radar continued to run until about 11:30
    when DPW assisted him (remotely) to switch the receiver units off and then on
    again. This failed to solve the problem of the first few attempts. However, DPW
    eventually disconnected and then re-connected various wires from the receiver.
    The problem was gone when the radar was restarted at around 12:15. '
