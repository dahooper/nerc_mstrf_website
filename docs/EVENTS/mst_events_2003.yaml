    data between 3rd and 14th April. At first it was thought that the anemometer had
    developed a

    A hand winch

    was purchased to enable the tower to be lowered to ground level for inspection.
    ZAKO traced

    the source of the problem to corrosion of an electrical connector between the
    wind measuring

    equipment and the data logging unit. He cleaned and then thoroughly resealed the
    connector in

    order to avoid a repetition of the problem.'
