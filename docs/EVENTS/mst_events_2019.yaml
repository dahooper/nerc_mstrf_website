    to have been a power outage at the radar site between approximately 16:42 and
    18:07 UTC - possibly as the result of strong surface winds. DAH spotted this shortly
    after the power was restored and was able to remotely restart the MST radar at
    19:52 UTC. The Vaisala WXT520 data acquisition was restarted at 18:54 UTC. The
    Sky-Camera-2 acquisition restarted automatically when PC julius restarted. PC
    gaius failed to restart automatically and so, at the time of writing, Vaisala
    LD40 acquisition has not restarted. Data from the Campbell Scientific surface
    met and wind sensors can only be downloaded when PC gaius is back in operation
    and so it is not yet known if the data acquisition was affected.     '

  text: Data between 01:00 and 03:00 UTC should be ignored. A bug in the netCDF file
    creation software causes times between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC to be interpreted as
    occurring one hour later on the day when civil time changes between Greenwich
    Mean Time (GMT) and British Summer Time (BST). The source of the problem has been
    identified and tests have shown that it interprets times prior to 01:00 UTC and
    those after 02:00 UTC correctly. However, since it is impossible to distinguish
    between cycles that actually occurred between 02:00 and 03:00 and those that occurred
    between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC, data for this period should be ignored.

  text: Instrument MST Radar. The altitude coverage was noticeably reduced during
    this period. This was initially thought to have been caused by more than one transmitter
    being out of action. However, it turns out to have been the result of the output
    voltage of a new UPS unit for TXE being set to 220 V rather than the 240 V preferred
    by the transmitters. It's not entirely clear why the altitude coverage was lower
    when TXE was in operation at the lower voltage than when it was out of operation.
