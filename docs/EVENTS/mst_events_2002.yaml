  text: "The hard-drive on the Master-PC, which controls the MST Radar, failed on\
    \ 27th August. It was replaced almost immediately by the nominally identical Backup-PC\n\
    \ and normal operations were resumed with only a minor loss of coverage. The working\
    \ hard-drive on the Backup-PC has been cloned so that the PC can be repaired quickly\
    \ in the event of another hard-drive failure. Tests have shown \nthat the Backup-PC\
    \ works with the cloned hard-drive. Although the Master and Backup PCs were supposed\
    \ to be identical, there are slight differences between\nthem which means that\
    \ the Master-PC does not function correctly with the cloned hard-drive.\nEfforts\
    \ to restore the Master-PC to working order are on-going. It is thought that the\
    \ interface\nand network drivers will need to be reinstalled."
