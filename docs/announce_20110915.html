<B>ERROR IN LASER CEILOMETER CLOUD BASE FILES, 2nd NOVEMBER 2010 - 10th
  SEPTEMBER 2011</B><BR><BR>

<B>The Problem</B><BR>

The Vaisala LD40 laser ceilometer cloud base altitude files contain an error
in the observation times for the period 2nd November 2010 - 10th September
2011, inclusive. The recorded times were offset relative to the actual times
by:<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>+4 hours 00 minutes at the beginning of the affected period (i.e. 
    2nd November 2010)
  <LI>+3 hours 57 minutes at the end of the affected period (i.e. 
    10th September 2011)  
</UL>

the difference in offset being caused by a slow drift in the instrument's
internal clock (<A href="#cause">see below</A>). The plots of the latest 24 hours' worth of laser
ceilometer data, which are available through the Facility's supplementary
website
<A href="http://www.mstrf.eclipse.co.uk/">http://www.mstrf.eclipse.co.uk/</A>,
have been free from this problem since at least March 2011. <BR><BR>

The NASA-Ames cloud base data files, and their corresponding quick-look plots,
were removed from the BADC on 12th September 2011. Data files for 11th
September 2011 onwards are not affected by this problem. <BR><BR>

<B>Replacing the affected files</B><BR>

Replacement files, with corrected observation times, can easily be generated
for individual days on request. However, this will rely on a manual inspection
of the raw data files on a day-by-day basis. Owing to the underlying and
ongoing problem of slow instrument clock drift, an automatic software solution
is required in the longer term. All of the removed files will be recreated
once the updated software is operational. A confirmation will be added to
this page when the task has been completed. <BR><BR>

<A name="cause">
<B>Cause of the problem</B><BR>

Data messages produced by the instrument contain a date-time stamp which is
generated by its internal, free-running clock. The latter

<UL>
  <LI>is not very accurate - as demonstrated above, it drifts by around 15
    s per month
  <LI>is non-trivial to resynchronise - requiring someone to connect to it
    with a laptop in the field
</UL>

The data messages are captured by a program (written by a member of Met Office
staff) which is run on a network time protocol (NTP) enabled computer. This
software writes all messages which arrive on a given UT day (as determined by
the computer rather than by the date-time stamps of the messages) to a single
file. Consequently it is possible to determine the actual observation times to
within the nearest minute (i.e. the interval between data messages) without
having to consider the date-time stamps produced by the instrument. Clearly it
would be more-appropriate to capture the data messages together with a
date-time stamp generated by the acquisition computer. Nevertheless, the
self-adjusting correction method will be adopted when the NASA-Ames file
generation software is updated in the near future. At present the instrument's
date-time stamps are corrected by a hard-coded offset. <BR><BR>

When the current time error came to light, it was thought that an incorrect
offset value had been applied when it was last updated on 2nd August 2010. On
that occasion, the instrument's clock had been passively reset as a result of
the electricity supply to the site being down for most of the day. However,
further investigation revealed that the internal clock had again been
passively reset at 09:14 UT on 2nd November 2010. This appears to have been
caused by the first of three brief mains disruptions which were detected by
the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units. The LD40 is not powered by a
UPS. The clock reset went unnoticed at the time.
