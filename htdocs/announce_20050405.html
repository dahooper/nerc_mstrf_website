<B>Putting the M back into MST</B><BR>
Mesospheric-mode observations, covering the approximate altitude range
56 - 94 km, will be reintroduced from Wednesday 6th April 2005 - the
first time since November 1999. This will not have a large impact on
the ST-mode (2 - 20 km) observations, since only two extra dwells are
being added to the current observation cycle. One will be a vertical
beam dwell for the M-mode and the second will be a vertical beam dwell
for the ST-mode. This will ensure that ST-mode vertical velocity
profiles are still available at regular 46 s intervals (as they have
been since June 2004). Users will need to access the radial data files
in order to retrieve the high resolution information. The interval
between horizontal velocity profiles (given in the Cartesian data
files) will increase from 3 minutes 50 seconds to 4 minutes 36
seconds. Full details of these changes can be found <A
href="#full">below</A>.<BR><BR>

<B>A warning for users of version-0 radial data products.</B><BR> 

Version-2 signal processing automatically separates M and ST mode data
into different files (as well as separating data by range
resolution). However, version-0 radial data products are all written
together in the same files. Depending on how they have written their
reading routines, users may need to make slight changes if they want
to ensure that only single mode data are considered. An indication
that M-mode data are included for a particular dwell is given in line
type 6 - <A href="file_format_v0_rw.html">see here</A> for further
details. It appears that only ST mode data are written in the
version-0 wind files.<BR><BR>

Users wishing to test their software are directed to the data for 12th
June 1997, for which both M and ST mode observations are
available. The situation for this date is a little different to that
which is planned for the future - in that the M and ST mode
observations are not interlaced within the same cycle - but this will
give an indication of how the modes can be identified from the header
lines.

<B>Further details about the new observation format</B><BR>

The ST mode observation format used from 21st June 2004 - 5th April
2005 is as follows:<BR>


<PRE>
 Dwell number    :    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10
 Beam direction  :  NE6 Vert  SW6 Vert  SE6 Vert  NW6 Vert W4.2 Vert
 Range Resolution:  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300
 Mode            :   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST
</PRE>

Each dwell has a duration of approximately 23 s and so the total cycle
time is 3 minutes 50 seconds. Although only one horizontal wind
profile is available per cycle, vertical velocity profiles are
available every other dwell, i.e. at intervals of 46 s, from the
radial data files. 

The new format, to be introduced on 6th April 2005, is identical
except that it has two extra dwells per cycle:<BR> 

<PRE>
 Dwell number    :    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12
 Beam direction  :  NE6 Vert  SW6 Vert  SE6 Vert  NW6 Vert W4.2 Vert Vert Vert
 Range Resolution:  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300  300 1200  300
 Mode            :   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST   ST    M   ST
</PRE>

<B>Note (added 11th April 2005):</B> Owing to technical problems
encountered when trying to observe the mesosphere at 1200 m range
resolution, observations are now being made at 300 m resolution
instead.<BR><BR>

Since the duration of the M mode dwell is identical to that of ST mode
dwells (23 s), vertical velocity profiles will still be available at
regular 46 s intervals. The separation between horizontal wind
profiles will increase slightly to 4 minutes 36 seconds.<BR><BR>

<B>Why bother making M mode observations at all?</B><BR>

Clearly with only vertical beam observations available for the M mode,
it will not be possible to derive horizontal winds. Nevertheless the
new observations will be invaluable for establishing when, and from
which altitudes, mesospheric radar returns are observed. As can be seen
from the <A
href="http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/cgi-bin/data_browser/data_browser/badc/mst/plots/1997/06/radar-mst_capel-dewi_19970612_m1200.png">quick-look
plot</A> for the 12th June 1997 case, referred to above, detectable
radar returns are from discrete layers of narrow vertical
extent. Moreover, they tend to occur only sporadically. However, M
mode observations have never been made in a systematic way with the
Aberystwyth radar. Although observations lasting several hours (albeit
on arbitrary days) were made in the early 1990s, as can also be seen
from the quick-look plot for the 12th June 1997 case, much shorter
(and less frequent) observations were made thereafter.<BR><BR>

Attention tended to be focused on the unusually strong and persistent
echoes observed around 85 km during June and July (as seen for the
12th June 1997 case). These are analogous to the Polar Mesosphere
Summer Echoes (PMSEs), observed at higher latitudes, which are known
to be associated with the extra-ordinarily low temperature of the
summer mesopause level. The low temperature is also responsible for
the occurrence of noctilucent clouds (NLC), which can sometimes be seen
from Aberystwyth during mid-summer nights. If you would like more
