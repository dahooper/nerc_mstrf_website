THE NERC MST RADAR FACILITY AT ABERYSTWYTH
CONDITIONS OF DATA USE

Data from the instruments at the NERC MST Radar Facility at Aberystwyth are
freely available subject to the following conditions:

DATA PROTECTION ACT
For the purposes of tracking data usage and of improving the service,
user and project details submitted to the NERC MST Radar Facility will
be made available to the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)
and its delegated authorities. The latter include the staff of the
British Atmospheric Data Centre (BADC) and members of the NERC
Atmospheric Radar Facilities Steering Committee (NARFSC). The details
of publications making use of data from the Facility will be made
publicly available. As described below, current projects may be
alluded to in the Facility's annual report to NERC, which is publicly
available.

PURPOSE OF USE
The data are only to be used for bona fide academic research or
educational purposes. People requiring the data for commercial
purposes should contact the NERC MST Radar Facility Project Scientist
directly.


OWNERSHIP AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The data remain the property of the appropriate funding body and may
NOT be sold or otherwise passed on to a third party. Where the data
are used in a presentation or publication, an acknowledgement MUST be
given:

In the case of data from the MST Radar, the surface meteorological
sensors, the surface wind sensors, or the ceilometer, a sentence
should be given along the lines of - "The MST Radar Facility at
Aberystwyth is funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council
and the data are provided through the British Atmospheric Data
Centre."

In the case of data from the Met Office's boundary-layer wind-profiler
or GPS water-vapour receiver, a sentence should be given along the
lines of - "Data from the boundary-layer wind-profiler/GPS
water-vapour receiver are provided courtesy of the Met Office through
the British Atmospheric Data Centre."

In the case of data from the RAL cloud radar, a sentence should be
given along the lines of - "Data from the cloud radar are provided
courtesy of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory Millimetre-Wave
Technology Group through the British Atmospheric Data
Centre."

NON-UK DATA USERS
The remit of NERC is to fund and to manage scientific research and
training within the UK. Although NERC is happy for non-UK users to
make use of data from the MST Radar Facility, it only expects the
Facility's staff to provide them with limited support. Moreover, in
order for NERC to gain the appropriate credit for supporting science,
it is necessary for publications making use of data from the Facility
to include a UK-based author. Non-UK data users who do not have a
direct collaboration with a UK-based scientist are therefore obliged
to include the Facility's Project Scientist as a co-author on any
publications.

SUPPORTING SCIENTIFIC CASE (SSC)
In order to ensure continued funding of the Facility, it is important
to demonstrate to the NERC that there is a sufficient demand for the
data products and that the scientific research, for which they are
being used, is of a high quality. For this reason, as soon as a new
user applies for access to the dataset through the BADC, they will be
contacted by the NERC MST Radar Facility Project Scientist; they will
be requested to submit a Supporting Scientific Case (SSC) which
describes how they intend to make use of the data and full access will
only be granted once this has been returned. The level of detail
required in the SSC will depend on the intended use of the data.

ANNUAL PROJECT UPDATES
In addition to providing an SSC at the beginning of their projects,
users are obliged to supply a project update at the end of each
financial year. This description does not need to be very long (a
paragraph might suffice) or very detailed. However, it should provide
sufficient information to allow members of the NARFSC to appreciate
how data from the Facility have been used over the preceding financial
year (April - March). The emphasis here is on results and
achievements, as opposed to the hopes and intentions outlined in the
SSC. Text written for another purpose - e.g. the abstract of a recent
paper or presentation - may be submitted if it fulfils the criteria
outlined above. Projects may be alluded to in the "Science Highlights"
section of the Facility's Annual Report to NERC, which is publicly
available, although users will not be identified by name.  When the
Facility's Project Scientist contacts users (at some point between
January and March each year) to request this information, they will
also be required to supply details of the following:

  Publications: including those appearing in books, newspapers,
    magazines, newsletters, websites, Masters and PhD theses,
    conference proceedings, and refereed journals. These details will
    be made publicly available through the Facility's website.

  Presentations: including those given at conferences, seminars and
    colloquia.

End of conditions of data use.
