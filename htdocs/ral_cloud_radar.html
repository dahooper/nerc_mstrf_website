A frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) 78 GHz cloud radar,
designed by the Millimetre-Wave Technology (MMT) group of the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), began operations at the MST
radar site on 14th April 2005. It detects the Rayleigh scattered
signals from hydrometeors. Since the radar return signal power
increases with increasing hydrometeor size, but decreases with
increasing range from the radar, the instrument's sensitivity to
clouds depends on the cloud type. It has proved itself capable
of detecting fog, which was not previously thought to be possible for
a cloud radar. It has primarily been operated over the altitude range
0 - 16 km, with measurements recorded at intervals of 30 m in altitude
and 30 s in time. Other altitude ranges and sampling intervals are
user-selectable. Since this is still an experimental instrument, which
is undergoing development (see below), the data files merely contain
altitude profiles of radar return signal power. These have neither
been range corrected nor converted into cloud products. In order to
aid the development of this instrument, the MMT group would like to
know how the data are being usedt will be
useful for the MMT group to know how the data from their instrument s

Those making
use of the data from the cloud radar are asked to keep the MST Radar
Facility Project Scientist informed of their progress so that The instrument
is likely to return to RAL in September 2005 to allow further
development work to be undertaken.<BR><BR>


<B>History of the radar.</B><BR> 
The radar started life as an altimeter (a device for measuring the
altitude of an aircraft above the ground). It was modified for
atmospheric profiling in the mid 1990s and spent some time in
operation at the MST radar site at this early stage. Since then it has
undergone considerable development within the RAL MMT group with
support from the Met Office. It has been deployed on a number of
campaigns both within the UK (e.g. at the Met Office's Camborne site)
and abroad (in both Switzerland and Mauritius). Since the instrument
was not designed with an active cooling system, it must be switched
off during hot weather to prevent overheating. Data are not therefore
available on a continuous basis. A known issue arises from the very
strong low-altitude radar returns associated with rainfall. These give
rise to "banding", whereby saturation effects increase the baseline
across a large range of altitudes. Rather than modifying the present
version of the radar, it is planned to address the rain saturation and
cooling problems in a future prototype demonstration model.<BR><BR>

<B>What's unusual about this radar.</B><BR> 
Cloud radars typically transmit pulsed signals (in the same way as the
MST radar) and determine the range of targets from the delay between
the transmission and reception of a pulse. Owing to the relatively
high peak transmitted powers (~ 1 kW), they rely on expensive vacuum
valves, which are prone to degradation over time scales of 1 - 2
years. An alternative technique is to "chirp" the signal, i.e. to
linearly sweep the transmitter frequency, and to determine the range
of a target from the frequency difference between the transmitter and
receiver signals. Since signals are transmitted for a much longer
period than in the case of pulsed radar (there are still gaps between
chirps), detectable return signals can be achieved with a much lower
peak transmitter power (200 mW in the case of the RAL radar). This
means that FMCW radars can be designed around lower-cost and
more-reliable solid-state components.<BR><BR>
