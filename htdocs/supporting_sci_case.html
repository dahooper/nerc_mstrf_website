Submission of a Supporting Scientific Case (SSC) is a prerequisite for
<A href="data_access.html">gaining access</A> to the NERC MST Radar
Facility dataset. <A href="data_conditions.html">Click here</A> to see
the full conditions of data use. <A href="#tplate">A template</A> for
the SSC can be downloaded from the bottom of this page. The only
grounds for rejecting an application are that the SSC is
insufficiently clear/detailed, or that it does not relate to a
legitimate use of the data; it should not, therefore, take long to
complete. The level of detail required will depend on which of the
following 6 categories your intended use of the data falls in to:<BR>

<DL>

  <DD><B>Educational</B> - i.e. you are a student who requires the
  data for an educational project; research-based-Masters and PhD
  students should apply through one of the other categories,
  i.e. Non-Core, Pilot, Specific or Experimental-Mode. You MUST have a
  supervisor, who is responsible for your application, and it will
  probably be appropriate for you to write the SSC together. The SSC
  should give a brief description of the scientific background to the
  project, state what the project aims to achieve and how it is
  intended to do this; it does not need to be more than 1 page in
  length.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Teaching</B> - i.e. you are a teacher or lecturer who
  requires the data solely for teaching purposes. The SSC should
  simply give a brief description of the course(s) for which the data
  will be used; it does not need to be more than 1 page in
  length.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Non-Core</B> - i.e. you require only the surface
  meteorological data or the surface wind data. The SSC should give a
  brief description of the scientific background to the project, state
  what the project aims to achieve and how it is intended to do this;
  it does not need to be more than 1 page in length.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Pilot</B> - i.e. you are initially uncertain as to how useful
  the data might be and so you want to gain access in order to
  investigate their potential. The SSC should give a description of
  the scientific background to the project, state what the project
  aims to achieve and explain how it is hoped that the data might be
  of use; it does not need to be more than 1 page in length. However,
  you should be prepared to submit a second, more detailed, Specific
  category SSC if it transpires that the data play an important role
  in your study.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Specific</B> - i.e. you have a clear idea of how the data
  will be used and/or they are central/essential to your study. The
  SSC should give a description of the scientific background to the
  project, state what the project aims to achieve and how it is
  intended to do this; it should be a MINIMUM of 1 page in
  length.<BR><BR>

  <DD><B>Operation of the MST Radar in an Experimental-Mode</B>
  i.e. you have specific requirements for the way in which the MST
  Radar should be operated. <A href="mst_guidelines.html">Click
  here</A> to read the guidelines for operation of the radar. The SSC
  should give the scientific background to the project, state what the
  project aims to achieve and how it is intended to do this; this
  should be a MINIMUM of 1 page in length. The SSC should also give
  details of the experimental-mode requirements, such as the necessary
  observation periods, the beam directions required, the altitude
  range to be covered, the range resolution and the time resolution.
  You should discuss these requirements with the <A
  href="contacting_facility_staff.html">NERC MST Radar Facility Project
  Scientist</A> before submitting an Experimental-Mode SSC. You may be
  required to include additional details, such as your relevant
  research experience or publication details, which might support your
  application. Note that Experimental-Mode SSCs should be submitted a
  MINIMUM of 3 months prior to the requirement for the radar to be
  operated in a special mode.  </DL>

Users are reminded that the primary purpose of the SSCs is for
tracking data usage. Therefore if you require the data for more than
one project, you should submit a separate SSC for each one. Moreover,
as described in the <A href="data_conditions.html#updates">Conditions
of Data Use</A>, you will be required to submit a brief project update
at the end of each financial year.<BR><BR>
