 and normal operations were resumed with only a minor loss of coverage. The working hard-drive on the Backup-PC has been cloned so that the PC can be repaired quickly in the event of another hard-drive failure. Tests have shown 
that the Backup-PC works with the cloned hard-drive. Although the Master and Backup PCs were supposed to be identical, there are slight differences between
them which means that the Master-PC does not function correctly with the cloned hard-drive.
Efforts to restore the Master-PC to working order are on-going. It is thought that the interface
and network drivers will need to be reinstalled.</event>

Rather than manifesting itself most strongly where the atmospheric signal is weakest, it is most prevalent in the altitude range 5 - 15 km. It appears to be caused by a secondary signal component, which is sufficiently close to the desired signal but with a slightly more positive Doppler velocity, for both to be identified (by v2 processing) as belonging to a single signal. The most obvious manifeststation is the persistent upward vertical velocities. v2 processing is able to filter out some of the contamination. v0 is clearly badly affected. v3 appears to be able to cope quite well.  </event>

However, the automatic feed was re-enabled around 16:00 once it was clear that all was well. The main result of this switch over is that the production of v0 and v2 files has been discontinued.

The new data acquisition system was recording invalid data for the M-mode, i.e. covering the approximate altitude range 56 - 94 km. The reason for this is that the hardware pre-processing unit ignores observations between range gates 192 and 385, inclusive. A hint of this was found in the source code for the original acquisition system. However, it was only by chance that DAH found a document which stated this explicitly. Appropriate changes were made to the new acquisition program on 2007-02-14. Note that the ST mode data (i.e. covering the approximate altitude range 2 - 20 km) are not affected by this issue.</event>

The altitude coverage of wind-profiles provided by the radar reduced significantly at around 05:30 UT on 2007-04-05 (a Thursday). This was not immediately apparent as a problem since variations in altitude coverage are commonly associated with changes in atmospheric structure. However, the altitude coverage was reduced to a very low level on 2007-04-06. Since this was Good Friday, the problem was not spotted by DAH until the following Tuesday, 2007-04-10 (Monday having also been a Bank Holiday), by which time the problem was less sever. The source of the problem was not immediately apparent. The radar return spectra suggested that reliable profiles (with good radial continuity) should be obtainable over a much greater altitude range. This prompted DAH to check the status of the dynamic signal processing. It turns out that dwells were not being archived once they had been finished with. The backlog stretched back to 2007/04/03 06 UT. This could have caused the time-continuity checks for the most recent data to have been performed against an inappropriate (out of date) reference. The prevalence of high pressure conditions over the past several days meant that the wind conditions had not changed sufficiently for the time continuity tests to have failed completely. DAH cleared the blockage at around 10:43 UT on 2007-04-10.  </event>

The v3 signal processing was doing a reasonable job of blanking the horizontal winds for this period although the vertical velocities appear to be contaminated. ZAKO and DAH blocked the transmission of data to the BADC and to the Met Office between 11:30 and 13:30 UT on 2007-05-18 whilst they undertook a series of tests to establish the cause of the problem. Switching receivers had no effect and the problem persisted when the the radar was operated with only one tranmsmitter at a time - except in the case of TX5, which was being used to phase-lock all 5 transitters. Consequently ZAKO switched phase-locking to TX2 and restarted the radar with all transmitters operating (and using the original receiver). This solved the problem. It is noted that this is a different type of interefence (denoted type-2) to the one which was commonly observed during 2006 (type-1). The latter is thought to be caused by an internal oscillation in the receive side of the radar system brought about by high temperatures. V3 processing contains a special algorithm to detect and to avoid type-1 interference, which is consequently much less of a problem even though it is much more commonly occurring.

This had a number of effects. The total cycle time was increased from just under 5 minutes to just under 10 minutes. Moreover, only 1 vertical beam observation was made per cycle at 300 m resolution. Typically these are made every other dwell and horizontal wind-components are derived using the vertical dwell which is closest in time to the corresponding off-vertical dwell. In the campaign mode, the separation between dwells could be up to 2 minutes (as opposed to just 24 s). The observation format has returned to that used prior to the campaign except that a Hanning data weightinmg window is not used instead of a Rectangular in deriving the Doppler spectra.</event>

However, the UPS units had already become discharged and so it was too late to shut down equipment in a controlled manner. Neverthless, everything came back up cleanly (except PC Gaius, which DPW restarted manually) when the power was resumed at around 14:20 UT.

LED encased the comms unit within a waterproof box (comms problems are thought to be typically associated with a build up of moisture within the data logging box), which allowed it to function for a short while. However, the problem was finally cured by LED tapping the comms unit with the back-end of a screwdriver. A poor connection appears to have been the limiting factor. 

In connection with this problem, no data were recorded between 2009/05/15 15:10 and 2009/06/08 07:30 UT. This situation was resolved when DAH reloaded the acquisition program to the logger.

The data for the first hour of operations after the equipment was re-installed, i.e. 2009-11-09 15:00 - 16:00 UT, should be ignored as repeated attempts were being made to correctly align the wind vane sensor. This process proved to be quite tricky and was virtually impossible to do using a compass and alignement by eye. The final attempt involved locking the wind vane in place and rotating the entire sensor until the real-time readings indicated that it was pointing towards north. A reading of 354.6 degrees was as close as could be managed. At first it was suspected that the sensor has been rotated by 180 degrees relative to its original alignment; the wind direction was not consistent with that seen at the lowest levels observed by the MST radar. However, when south-westerly winds began to dominate, it became clear that the alignment was correct.</event>

The beam steering unit malfunctioned, apparently becoming stuck in a single direction, which caused the wind-profile data to be erroneous. DAH initially stopped the radar at 09:57 UT on 2009-12-16, and DPW power-cycled the RX and pre-processor unit, in an attempt to clear a simultaneous interference problem. However, both problems persisted when the radar was restarted at 10:02 UT. The radar was stopped again at around 15:15 UT so that DPW could power-cycle the beam steering unit. This was initially effective, although the beam steering unit began to malfunction again at 18:15 UT. LD was able to visit site the following morning (2009-12-17). He found that one of the beam steering circuit boards was slightly loose and normal operation was resumed once this been corrected. The data feed to the Met Office, which had been blocked at the beginning of the problem, was not resumed until almost 17:30 UT since DAH was out of the office all day.

This primarily consisted of a series of interference bands, with (apparently) equal Doppler velocity spacing, affecting the lowest several range gates. A consequence of this was that vertical wind data were only available in the middle range gates and the horizontal winds were filtered out at all range gates by the quality control procedures. LD was able to visit the site on the afternoon of 2009-12-18 (a Friday), although he and DAH were unable to diagnose the cause of the problem. Consequently the radar was stopped at 15:30 UT and left idle over the weekend.

LD was able to be on site again on the morning of 2009-12-21 (the Monday). He and DAH followed the procedure used when a similar problem had been seen on 2007-05-17, when a phase-lock issue was suspected. All TXs were taken out of line and then, starting with TX4, made active whilst the spectra were inspected. Three TXs were up by about 12:00 on 2009-12-21. However, it was not until 16:00, that TX6, which had blown its choke earlier in the day, was activiated and the data feed was resumed. 

Spectra acquired for test purposes during the earlier part of 2009-12-21 were discarded.   </event>

The error code changed from "00000000" to "00050004", which (according to the Vasiala handbook) suggests: "Test laser failure. Error. No more measurements possible." The problem cleared by itself just over 24 hours later.  

The advice given by the Vasiala helpdesk is as follows:  According to the manual (M210256, revision D), the error descrpition reads for the fault 00050004 (error code 52):

"Check test laser: The test laser must be regulated to a constant output signal: Utlpm = 3.25 V. If the test laser output cannot be adjusted to the correct value by the software but the value is still within valid tolerance limits, the lower luminous intensity is compensated by way of calculation. If the software cannot adjust the test laser within the valid tolerance limits, a failure message is generated."

The solution to the error code, however, states:

"Replace the receiver module and/or the Main Board PCB 1540 and/or the test laser.
Refer to section Receiver Module Replacement on page 110."

So there might be fault in the receiver or Main board instead of the test laser, or in the worst case scenario, fault at multiple modules. 

If you have spare parts on location, you could try changing one or another of the mentioned modules to see if the error goes away. Changing the receiver module is described in the manual. Changing the test laser is not but it's easy since the part is connected only with two screws and a coax cable. 
Changing the mother board should be the last choice due its complexity and lack of instructions in the manual (it's prefarbly done at our service center).</event>

This meant that the time-continuity quality control algorithm was comparing current data with data which was more than 24 hours old. The reason that the problem had not shown up earlier was probably that the winds did not vary significantly during the preceding hours.

For some reason, communications between the radar control PC and the beam steering control PC became broken, which stopped from the beam direction changing from the Vertical. This resulted in the horizontal wind speed appearing (incorrectly) to be close to 0.0 m/s. DAH spotted this as soon as he reached the office and blocked the feed of data to the Met Office and interrupted the observation cycle shortly after 07 UT. He was able to localise the problem by examining the logs for both units. The beam steering controller PC was rebooted for good measure and LD changed phasing unit 77, which was flagged up as being faulty. However, the error message persisted with the replacement unit until LD investigated the wiring to the unit.

After several unsuccessful attempts to restart the transmitter by the usual method, LD set about investigating the transmitter. Based on advice from DPW, he tweaked the heater voltage measurement circuitry (effectively modifying the scaling factor; the actual voltage of 15 V registers as close to 10 V) to bring the values within the permissible range.
