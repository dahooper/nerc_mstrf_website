It was replaced almost immediately by the nominally identical Backup-PC\n and normal operations were resumed with only a minor loss of coverage. The working hard-drive on the Backup-PC has been cloned so that the PC can be repaired quickly in the event of another hard-drive failure. Tests have shown \nthat the Backup-PC works with the cloned hard-drive. Although the Master and Backup PCs were supposed to be identical, there are slight differences between\nthem which means that the Master-PC does not function correctly with the cloned hard-drive.\nEfforts to restore the Master-PC to working order are on-going. It is thought that the interface\nand network drivers will need to be reinstalled.",

This was not immediately apparent as a problem since variations in altitude coverage are commonly associated with changes in atmospheric structure. However, the altitude coverage was reduced to a very low level on 2007-04-06. Since this was Good Friday, the problem was not spotted by DAH until the following Tuesday, 2007-04-10 (Monday having also been a Bank Holiday), by which time the problem was less sever. The source of the problem was not immediately apparent. The radar return spectra suggested that reliable profiles (with good radial continuity) should be obtainable over a much greater altitude range. This prompted DAH to check the status of the dynamic signal processing. It turns out that dwells were not being archived once they had been finished with. The backlog stretched back to 2007/04/03 06 UT. This could have caused the time-continuity checks for the most recent data to have been performed against an inappropriate (out of date) reference. The prevalence of high pressure conditions over the past several days meant that the wind conditions had not changed sufficiently for the time continuity tests to have failed completely.

The v3 signal processing was doing a reasonable job of blanking the horizontal winds for this period although the vertical velocities appear to be contaminated. ZAKO and DAH blocked the transmission of data to the BADC and to the Met Office between 11:30 and 13:30 UT on 2007-05-18 whilst they undertook a series of tests to establish the cause of the problem. Switching receivers had no effect and the problem persisted when the the radar was operated with only one tranmsmitter at a time - except in the case of TX5, which was being used to phase-lock all 5 transitters. Consequently ZAKO switched phase-locking to TX2 and restarted the radar with all transmitters operating (and using the original receiver). This solved the problem. It is noted that this is a different type of interefence (denoted type-2) to the one which was commonly observed during 2006 (type-1). The latter is thought to be caused by an internal oscillation in the receive side of the radar system brought about by high temperatures.

The total cycle time was increased from just under 5 minutes to just under 10 minutes. Moreover, only 1 vertical beam observation was made per cycle at 300 m resolution. Typically these are made every other dwell and horizontal wind-components are derived using the vertical dwell which is closest in time to the corresponding off-vertical dwell. In the campaign mode, the separation between dwells could be up to 2 minutes (as opposed to just 24 s). The observation format has returned to that used prior to the campaign except that a Hanning data weightinmg window is not used instead of a Rectangular in deriving the Doppler spectra.",

However, the UPS units had already become discharged and so it was too late to shut down equipment in a controlled manner. Neverthless, everything came back up cleanly (except PC Gaius, which DPW restarted manually) when the power was resumed at around 14:20 UT.

There has been an intermittent  problem with the comms link to the data logger which has prevented the data from being downloaded. LED encased the comms unit within a waterproof box (comms problems are thought to be typically associated with a build up of moisture within the data logging box), which allowed it to function for a short while. However, the problem was finally cured by LED tapping the comms unit with the back-end of a screwdriver. A poor connection appears to have been the limiting factor. \n\nIn connection with this problem, no data were recorded between 2009/05/15 15:10 and 2009/06/08 07:30 UT. This situation was resolved when DAH reloaded the acquisition program to the logger. It turns out that the unit had been power cycled, in an attempt to diagnose the initial problem, and this had caused the logger to lose its program. ",

The data for the first hour of operations after the equipment was re-installed, i.e. 2009-11-09 15:00 - 16:00 UT, should be ignored as repeated attempts were being made to correctly align the wind vane sensor. This process proved to be quite tricky and was virtually impossible to do using a compass and alignement by eye. The final attempt involved locking the wind vane in place and rotating the entire sensor until the real-time readings indicated that it was pointing towards north. A reading of 354.6 degrees was as close as could be managed. At first it was suspected that the sensor has been rotated by 180 degrees relative to its original alignment; the wind direction was not consistent with that seen at the lowest levels observed by the MST radar.

This was initially effective, although the beam steering unit began to malfunction again at 18:15 UT. LD was able to visit site the following morning (2009-12-17).

This primarily consisted of a series of interference bands, with (apparently) equal Doppler velocity spacing, affecting the lowest several range gates. A consequence of this was that vertical wind data were only available in the middle range gates and the horizontal winds were filtered out at all range gates by the quality control procedures. LD was able to visit the site on the afternoon of 2009-12-18 (a Friday), although he and DAH were unable to diagnose the cause of the problem. Consequently the radar was stopped at 15:30 UT and left idle over the weekend.\n\nLD was able to be on site again on the morning of 2009-12-21 (the Monday). He and DAH followed the procedure used when a similar problem had been seen on 2007-05-17, when a phase-lock issue was suspected. All TXs were taken out of line and then, starting with TX4, made active whilst the spectra were inspected. Three TXs were up by about 12:00 on 2009-12-21. However, it was not until 16:00, that TX6, which had blown its choke earlier in the day, was activiated and the data feed was resumed. \n\nSpectra acquired for test purposes during the earlier part of 2009-12-21 were discarded.

If the test laser output cannot be adjusted to the correct value by the software but the value is still within valid tolerance limits, the lower luminous intensity is compensated by way of calculation. If the software cannot adjust the test laser within the valid tolerance limits, a failure message is generated.\"\n\nThe solution to the error code, however, states:\n\n\"Replace the receiver module and/or the Main Board PCB 1540 and/or the test laser.\nRefer to section Receiver Module Replacement on page 110.\"\n\nSo there might be fault in the receiver or Main board instead of the test laser, or in the worst case scenario, fault at multiple modules. \n\nIf you have spare parts on location, you could try changing one or another of the mentioned modules to see if the error goes away. Changing the receiver module is described in the manual. Changing the test laser is not but it's easy since the part is connected only with two screws and a coax cable. \nChanging the mother board should be the last choice due its complexity and lack of instructions in the manual (it's prefarbly done at our service center).",

For some reason, communications between the radar control PC and the beam steering control PC became broken, which stopped from the beam direction changing from the Vertical. This resulted in the horizontal wind speed appearing (incorrectly) to be close to 0.0 m/s. DAH spotted this as soon as he reached the office and blocked the feed of data to the Met Office and interrupted the observation cycle shortly after 07 UT. He was able to localise the problem by examining the logs for both units. The beam steering controller PC was rebooted for good measure and LD changed phasing unit 77, which was flagged up as being faulty. However, the error message persisted with the replacement unit until LD investigated the wiring to the unit. This cleared the problem without LD having discovered any obvious problem, suggested that a sub-optimal connection was to blame. Incidentally, ATRAD happened to be monitoring the beam steering controller unit at the time and sent an alert by e-mail.     ",

        "text": "Instrument: MST Radar. The radar suffered intermittently from a raised noise floor during this period. This led to corresponding reductions in useful altitude coverage. At first it was thought that the radar was suffering from receiver interference, which usually passes off without any intervention having to be taken. However, when the problem persisted, suspicion turned to the transmitters. A similar problem used to be seen when the transmitter powering antenna sector A shut down with an analogue error. Consequently, LD took out of action first the transmitter for sector A (09:38 - 15:48 UT on 2013-11-14) and then the transmitter for sector B (15:48 - 17:00 UT on 2013-11-14). Neither action had any effect. The radar was stopped briefly (09:39 - 09:58 UT on 2013-11-15) on the following day. Transmitter A was out of action 11:07 - 12:26 UT and transmitter B 12:05 - 15:50 UT. Finally, LD disconnected the receiver feed for transmitter E (but left the transmitter connected) and this solved the problem.  ",

Although the quick-look plots appear to have been updating for the next 3 days, the spectral files were not being transferred up to RAL. The quick-look plots stopped updating at 2013-12-31  18:41. DAH did not spot the problem until 11:08 the following day. However, it took him 3 attempts at remotely power-cycling the modem before he could re-establish a connection. Connectivity did not last for long and despite numerous attempts that day and the next, he only re-established it briefly on a few occasions. The ISP was closed on New Year's Day and so DAH had to wait until 2014-01-02 before speaking to them. LD came to the site that morning and established that the \"fax\" line (used for the broadband connection) was very noisy. He switched the modem to the Manchester University \"phone\" line for a while (this was primarily to allow the backlog of Met Office messages to upload). However, under instructions from the ISP he reconnected the modem to the \"fax\" line in case Open Reach began line testing the following morning. The ISP changed their advice the following day (Friday 2014-01-03) since it had now been established that the problem was classified as a phone line fault and not a broadband one. Apparently an Open Reach engineer attempted to visit the site at around 10:00 on Sunday 2014-01-05, but obviously found no-one there. They are now scheduled to return on the afternoon of 2014-01-09.

LD spotted from the quick-look plots that something was wrong at around 16:00 and was on site at around 17:00. He was surprised to find that the radar was apparently working and called DAH, who had not yet spotted the gap in data. DAH quickly established the immediate (rather than the underlying) cause of the problem and removed the spectral files for the period 14:15 - 15:21. He subsequently established that the gap between dwells (which is normally around 25 s) suddenly increased to over 7 minutes after the 3rd dwell of the cycle. There was a gap of over 20 minutes after the 5th dwell. There is no indication as to what might have caused this problem. The logs seem to rule out a communications failure with the beam steering unit. They do, however, show that the forward power was low for antenna sectors B and E 14:20 - 14:23 UT, and for sectors A, B, and C 14:28 - 14:53 UT. ",

At first, the fact that the latest data quick look plots were not being updated was attributed to an internet problem. However, LD discovered the fault during a visit to the site on the afternoon of 2018-04-01 and he rebooted the PC. Although this restored some functionality - the latest MST radar data plots were being updated, but showed no data - the performance of the PC was very poor even for command line functions such listing directory contents. The performance of the PC appears to have improved by itself without any additional intervention having been taken. PC claudius is quite old and is due to be replaced within the next week. ",

DAH spotted this shortly after the power was restored and was able to remotely restart the MST radar at 19:52 UTC. The Vaisala WXT520 data acquisition was restarted at 18:54 UTC. The Sky-Camera-2 acquisition restarted automatically when PC julius restarted. PC gaius failed to restart automatically and so, at the time of writing, Vaisala LD40 acquisition has not restarted. Data from the Campbell Scientific surface met and wind sensors can only be downloaded when PC gaius is back in operation and so it is not yet known if the data acquisition was affected.     ",

A bug in the netCDF file creation software causes times between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC to be interpreted as occurring one hour later on the day when civil time changes between Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and British Summer Time (BST). The source of the problem has been identified and tests have shown that it interprets times prior to 01:00 UTC and those after 02:00 UTC correctly. However, since it is impossible to distinguish between cycles that actually occurred between 02:00 and 03:00 and those that occurred between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC, data for this period should be ignored.",

DAH did not notice this until the following morning (at around 2019-09-06 10:00 UTC), when LD confirmed that the transmitters had been back in operation since approximately 2019-09-05 16:00 UTC. DAH removed the spectral files for the period 2019-09-05 14:08 - 17:01 UTC, which allowed the data processing software to continue automatically.",
