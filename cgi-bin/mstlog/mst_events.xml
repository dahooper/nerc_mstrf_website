 and normal operations were resumed with only a minor loss of coverage. The working hard-drive on the Backup-PC has been cloned so that the PC can be repaired quickly in the event of another hard-drive failure. Tests have shown 
that the Backup-PC works with the cloned hard-drive. Although the Master and Backup PCs were supposed to be identical, there are slight differences between
them which means that the Master-PC does not function correctly with the cloned hard-drive.
Efforts to restore the Master-PC to working order are on-going. It is thought that the interface
and network drivers will need to be reinstalled.</event>

Rather than manifesting itself most strongly where the atmospheric signal is weakest, it is most prevalent in the altitude range 5 - 15 km. It appears to be caused by a secondary signal component, which is sufficiently close to the desired signal but with a slightly more positive Doppler velocity, for both to be identified (by v2 processing) as belonging to a single signal. The most obvious manifeststation is the persistent upward vertical velocities. v2 processing is able to filter out some of the contamination. v0 is clearly badly affected. v3 appears to be able to cope quite well.  </event>

Initially the v3 data stream to the Met Office was blocked to allow DAH to check that all systems were integrated correctly. However, the automatic feed was re-enabled around 16:00 once it was clear that all was well. The main result of this switch over is that the production of v0 and v2 files has been discontinued. Only v3 processing software was adapted to operate on the netCDF spectral files created by the new acqusition system. Users should note that the signal powers in the v3 radial and Cartesian files have jumped by an offset of approximately 70 dB as a result of the way in which spectral data are now stored.   </event>

The new data acquisition system was recording invalid data for the M-mode, i.e. covering the approximate altitude range 56 - 94 km. The reason for this is that the hardware pre-processing unit ignores observations between range gates 192 and 385, inclusive. A hint of this was found in the source code for the original acquisition system. However, it was only by chance that DAH found a document which stated this explicitly. Appropriate changes were made to the new acquisition program on 2007-02-14. Note that the ST mode data (i.e. covering the approximate altitude range 2 - 20 km) are not affected by this issue.</event>

The altitude coverage of wind-profiles provided by the radar reduced significantly at around 05:30 UT on 2007-04-05 (a Thursday). This was not immediately apparent as a problem since variations in altitude coverage are commonly associated with changes in atmospheric structure. However, the altitude coverage was reduced to a very low level on 2007-04-06. Since this was Good Friday, the problem was not spotted by DAH until the following Tuesday, 2007-04-10 (Monday having also been a Bank Holiday), by which time the problem was less sever. The source of the problem was not immediately apparent. The radar return spectra suggested that reliable profiles (with good radial continuity) should be obtainable over a much greater altitude range. This prompted DAH to check the status of the dynamic signal processing. It turns out that dwells were not being archived once they had been finished with. The backlog stretched back to 2007/04/03 06 UT. This could have caused the time-continuity checks for the most recent data to have been performed against an inappropriate (out of date) reference. The prevalence of high pressure conditions over the past several days meant that the wind conditions had not changed sufficiently for the time continuity tests to have failed completely. DAH cleared the blockage at around 10:43 UT on 2007-04-10.  </event>

The v3 signal processing was doing a reasonable job of blanking the horizontal winds for this period although the vertical velocities appear to be contaminated. ZAKO and DAH blocked the transmission of data to the BADC and to the Met Office between 11:30 and 13:30 UT on 2007-05-18 whilst they undertook a series of tests to establish the cause of the problem. Switching receivers had no effect and the problem persisted when the the radar was operated with only one tranmsmitter at a time - except in the case of TX5, which was being used to phase-lock all 5 transitters. Consequently ZAKO switched phase-locking to TX2 and restarted the radar with all transmitters operating (and using the original receiver). This solved the problem. It is noted that this is a different type of interefence (denoted type-2) to the one which was commonly observed during 2006 (type-1). The latter is thought to be caused by an internal oscillation in the receive side of the radar system brought about by high temperatures. V3 processing contains a special algorithm to detect and to avoid type-1 interference, which is consequently much less of a problem even though it is much more commonly occurring.

This had a number of effects. The total cycle time was increased from just under 5 minutes to just under 10 minutes. Moreover, only 1 vertical beam observation was made per cycle at 300 m resolution. Typically these are made every other dwell and horizontal wind-components are derived using the vertical dwell which is closest in time to the corresponding off-vertical dwell. In the campaign mode, the separation between dwells could be up to 2 minutes (as opposed to just 24 s). The observation format has returned to that used prior to the campaign except that a Hanning data weightinmg window is not used instead of a Rectangular in deriving the Doppler spectra.</event>

According to Manweb, this was caused by a broken insulator on an overhead cable. DPW, who came to the site during the afternoon, warned DAH that the power was down. However, the UPS units had already become discharged and so it was too late to shut down equipment in a controlled manner. Neverthless, everything came back up cleanly (except PC Gaius, which DPW restarted manually) when the power was resumed at around 14:20 UT. PC Augustus always takes a long time to restart after a reboot (owing to the disk check) and so DAH retstarted the MST Radar and the WXT510 acquisition programs from home later in the evening.   </event>

There has been an intermittent  problem with the comms link to the data logger which has prevented the data from being downloaded. LED encased the comms unit within a waterproof box (comms problems are thought to be typically associated with a build up of moisture within the data logging box), which allowed it to function for a short while. However, the problem was finally cured by LED tapping the comms unit with the back-end of a screwdriver. A poor connection appears to have been the limiting factor. 

In connection with this problem, no data were recorded between 2009/05/15 15:10 and 2009/06/08 07:30 UT. This situation was resolved when DAH reloaded the acquisition program to the logger.

The data for the first hour of operations after the equipment was re-installed, i.e. 2009-11-09 15:00 - 16:00 UT, should be ignored as repeated attempts were being made to correctly align the wind vane sensor. This process proved to be quite tricky and was virtually impossible to do using a compass and alignement by eye. The final attempt involved locking the wind vane in place and rotating the entire sensor until the real-time readings indicated that it was pointing towards north. A reading of 354.6 degrees was as close as could be managed. At first it was suspected that the sensor has been rotated by 180 degrees relative to its original alignment; the wind direction was not consistent with that seen at the lowest levels observed by the MST radar. However, when south-westerly winds began to dominate, it became clear that the alignment was correct.</event>

This was initially effective, although the beam steering unit began to malfunction again at 18:15 UT. LD was able to visit site the following morning (2009-12-17). He found that one of the beam steering circuit boards was slightly loose and normal operation was resumed once this been corrected. The data feed to the Met Office, which had been blocked at the beginning of the problem, was not resumed until almost 17:30 UT since DAH was out of the office all day.

This primarily consisted of a series of interference bands, with (apparently) equal Doppler velocity spacing, affecting the lowest several range gates. A consequence of this was that vertical wind data were only available in the middle range gates and the horizontal winds were filtered out at all range gates by the quality control procedures. LD was able to visit the site on the afternoon of 2009-12-18 (a Friday), although he and DAH were unable to diagnose the cause of the problem. Consequently the radar was stopped at 15:30 UT and left idle over the weekend.

LD was able to be on site again on the morning of 2009-12-21 (the Monday). He and DAH followed the procedure used when a similar problem had been seen on 2007-05-17, when a phase-lock issue was suspected. All TXs were taken out of line and then, starting with TX4, made active whilst the spectra were inspected. Three TXs were up by about 12:00 on 2009-12-21. However, it was not until 16:00, that TX6, which had blown its choke earlier in the day, was activiated and the data feed was resumed. 

Spectra acquired for test purposes during the earlier part of 2009-12-21 were discarded.   </event>

The error code changed from "00000000" to "00050004", which (according to the Vasiala handbook) suggests: "Test laser failure. Error. No more measurements possible." The problem cleared by itself just over 24 hours later.  

The advice given by the Vasiala helpdesk is as follows:  According to the manual (M210256, revision D), the error descrpition reads for the fault 00050004 (error code 52):

"Check test laser: The test laser must be regulated to a constant output signal: Utlpm = 3.25 V. If the test laser output cannot be adjusted to the correct value by the software but the value is still within valid tolerance limits, the lower luminous intensity is compensated by way of calculation. If the software cannot adjust the test laser within the valid tolerance limits, a failure message is generated."

The solution to the error code, however, states:

"Replace the receiver module and/or the Main Board PCB 1540 and/or the test laser.
Refer to section Receiver Module Replacement on page 110."

So there might be fault in the receiver or Main board instead of the test laser, or in the worst case scenario, fault at multiple modules. 

If you have spare parts on location, you could try changing one or another of the mentioned modules to see if the error goes away. Changing the receiver module is described in the manual. Changing the test laser is not but it's easy since the part is connected only with two screws and a coax cable. 
Changing the mother board should be the last choice due its complexity and lack of instructions in the manual (it's prefarbly done at our service center).</event>

This meant that the time-continuity quality control algorithm was comparing current data with data which was more than 24 hours old. The reason that the problem had not shown up earlier was probably that the winds did not vary significantly during the preceding hours.

This resulted in the horizontal wind speed appearing (incorrectly) to be close to 0.0 m/s. DAH spotted this as soon as he reached the office and blocked the feed of data to the Met Office and interrupted the observation cycle shortly after 07 UT. He was able to localise the problem by examining the logs for both units.

He was surprised to find that the radar was apparently working and called DAH, who had not yet spotted the gap in data. DAH quickly established the immediate (rather than the underlying) cause of the problem and removed the spectral files for the period 14:15 - 15:21. He subsequently established that the gap between dwells (which is normally around 25 s) suddenly increased to over 7 minutes after the 3rd dwell of the cycle. There was a gap of over 20 minutes after the 5th dwell. There is no indication as to what might have caused this problem. The logs seem to rule out a communications failure with the beam steering unit. They do, however, show that the forward power was low for antenna sectors B and E 14:20 - 14:23 UT, and for sectors A, B, and C 14:28 - 14:53 UT. </event>

He was able to remotely restart the radar at 12:40 UT, although the beam steering unit does not appear to have been changing the beam pointing direction (DAH had blocked the transfer of data to the Met Office during the restart period). It gave a warning message, "Refusing connection. Beam command socket already connected". Consequently DAH stopped the radar at 13:15 UT before rebooting the beam steering PC, which does not appear to have shut down during the electricity outage. The beam steering unit appeared to operate as expected when DAH restarted the radar at 13:45 UT. However, he did not remove the block from the Met Office's data feed until around 15:30 UT, when he was confident that everything was back to normal.</event>

An input power problem at 2015-11-06 20:40 led to the UPS unit for the transmitter powering antenna sector C to shut down. This unit is known (from self-tests) to have a faulty battery pack. The delivery of a replacement pack has been delayed by supplier problems. This UPS unit also powers the phase synchronistaion unit, which must be in operation in order for the transmitters to be able to transmit. However, the receiver continued to acquire (noise) data. DAH spotted this on the following morning and stopped the radar at 08:20 in an attempt to diagnose the problem. He restarted the radar at 10:06 but stopped it again at 10:58, when it became clear that the problem could not be resolved remotely. LD visited the site on the morning of 2015-11-09 and swapped the recently replaced battery pack from the UPS for TXA to the UPS for TXC.

The transmitter could not be powered through an adjacent UPS unit since the combined load of two transmitters was too large for one unit. Moreover, it couldn't be powered directly from the mains supply since the latter is reduced to 220 V by a "voltage optimisation unit". The transmitters require a input voltage of 240 V. The transmitter restarted operations after a replacement UPS unit was installed on 2016-03-08 11:24 UT. The transmitter was briefly in operation 11:05 - 11:20 UT and again for less than a minute at 11:52 UT before stable operations were resumed at 12:21 UT.</event>

Shortly afterwards (by 16:00) LD replaced the N-type connector on the input to the power splitter that feeds these units. The original connector had not been sealed properly and so had become corroded. LD suspected that the power splitter for units 41, 42, 51, and 52 might be suffering from a similar problem since he is getting unusual controller readings from this part of the atenna array.

They have large time-altitude regions of missing winds owing to a known issue the time-continuity quality-control algorithm when the external internet connection is down for more than 24 hours. The intermediate files are not cleared from the processing chain, which leads to wind data being compared with observations made at around the same time on previous days.

The data processing PC (claudius) developed a hard disk fault, which prevented it from processing MST radar data in a timely way. At first, the fact that the latest data quick look plots were not being updated was attributed to an internet problem. However, LD discovered the fault during a visit to the site on the afternoon of 2018-04-01 and he rebooted the PC. Although this restored some functionality - the latest MST radar data plots were being updated, but showed no data - the performance of the PC was very poor even for command line functions such listing directory contents. The performance of the PC appears to have improved by itself without any additional intervention having been taken. PC claudius is quite old and is due to be replaced within the next week. </event>

There appears to have been a power outage at the radar site between approximately 16:42 and 18:07 UTC - possibly as the result of strong surface winds. DAH spotted this shortly after the power was restored and was able to remotely restart the MST radar at 19:52 UTC. The Vaisala WXT520 data acquisition was restarted at 18:54 UTC. The Sky-Camera-2 acquisition restarted automatically when PC julius restarted. PC gaius failed to restart automatically and so, at the time of writing, Vaisala LD40 acquisition has not restarted. Data from the Campbell Scientific surface met and wind sensors can only be downloaded when PC gaius is back in operation and so it is not yet known if the data acquisition was affected.     </event>

A bug in the netCDF file creation software causes times between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC to be interpreted as occurring one hour later on the day when civil time changes between Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and British Summer Time (BST). The source of the problem has been identified and tests have shown that it interprets times prior to 01:00 UTC and those after 02:00 UTC correctly. However, since it is impossible to distinguish between cycles that actually occurred between 02:00 and 03:00 and those that occurred between 01:00 and 02:00 UTC, data for this period should be ignored.</event>

LD attached a dummy load to the receiver input at 2019-09-05 14:08 UTC in order to test if the noise problem was caused by the receiver itself. However, this caused the data processing software to crash (probably because of the lack of structure in the Doppler spectra). DAH did not notice this until the following morning (at around 2019-09-06 10:00 UTC), when LD confirmed that the transmitters had been back in operation since approximately 2019-09-05 16:00 UTC. DAH removed the spectral files for the period 2019-09-05 14:08 - 17:01 UTC, which allowed the data processing software to continue automatically.</event>

This was initially thought to have been caused by more than one transmitter being out of action. However, it turns out to have been the result of the output voltage of a new UPS unit for TXE being set to 220 V rather than the 240 V preferred by the transmitters. It's not entirely clear why the altitude coverage was lower when TXE was in operation at the lower voltage than when it was out of operation.</event>

The timing of rain events seen by the tipping bucket rain gauge during this period were often inconsistent with those apparent from the Vaisala LD40 laser ceilometer backscatter plots. In particular, the tipping bucket rain gauge showed rain continuing after the LD40 indicated that a rain event had ceased. This suggested a blockage in the tipping bucket. LD cleaned the inlet filter shortly before  2019-12-13 10:30 UTC. He reported that it had been covered in slime.

For reasons that are not clear, the output of the Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) unit for the receiver room appears to have cut out at around 07:45 UTC (none of the UPS units in the transmitter room reported any input power problems). The computers in the receiver room appear to have automatically restarted almost immediately. DAH was able to restart the MST Radar and the WXT520 data acquisition remotely, but had to wait for LD to visit the site in order to restart the LD40 data acquisition.   </event>

The gap in observations between 07:45 and 09:25 UTC was caused by a loss of power to the data acquisition computer.</event>

The radar experienced a raised noise floor between 13:45 and 14:15 UTC, which is more apparent in the m-mode data than the st-mode data. This was during a period of deep convection and intense rainfall, with 10 minute mean rates of around 30 mm/hour. The wind data are already flagged as being unreliable, which might be the result of the rapid vertical velocity variations caused by the convection.</event>

A communications error between the radar control and beam steering PCs, which first began at 17:16 UTC, led to the beam pointing direction only changing occasionally. It eventually led to the radar control software locking up. DAH rebooted both PCs and restarted the radar at 20:26 UTC.</event>
